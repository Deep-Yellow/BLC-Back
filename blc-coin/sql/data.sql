When communication infrastructures are destroyed by disasters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to perform immediate rescue missions in destroyed areas and assist data sharing for ground Internet of vehicles (IoV). However, in such UAV-assisted IoV under disaster situation, there exist potential security threats on data sharing among vehicles and UAVs because of the untrusted network environment, unreliable misbehavior tracing, and low-quality shared data. To address these issues, in this article, we develop a lightweight vehicular blockchain-enabled secure (LVBS) data sharing framework in UAV-aided IoV for disaster rescue. First, we propose a novel UAV and blockchain-assisted collaborative aerial-ground network architecture in disaster areas. Second, we develop a credit-based consensus algorithm in the lightweight vehicular blockchain to securely and immutably trace misbehaviors and record data transactions for UAVs and vehicles with improved efficiency and security in reaching consensus. Third, since UAVs and vehicles have little explicit knowledge of the whole network, we develop reinforcement learning-based algorithms to optimally schedule the pricing and quality of data sharing strategies for both data contributor and data consumer via trial and error. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, which demonstrate that LVBS can effectively improve the security of consensus phase and promote high-quality data sharing. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","blockchain; data sharing; disaster rescue; reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)Antennas; Blockchain; Disasters; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Communication infrastructure; Consensus algorithms; Data contributors; Disaster situations; Explicit knowledge; Extensive simulations; High quality data; Sharing strategies; Data Sharing","A");

In addition, consumers are also increasingly interested in the authenticity of food and want to ensure that they receive the right quality of food. To address this issue, there is a need for reliable and robust tools to be available in the Industry 4.0 era that can trace the food throughout the supply chain from the farm through processing until it reaches the customer and, thus, ensure transparency. Using the people, process, and technology (PPT) model, this paper develops a blockchain-enabled food supply chain framework including the future opportunities and the present impediments based on the systematic literature review and semi-structured case interviews from the context of emerging economies. The study investigates the suitability of blockchain technology in resolving major challenges, such as traceability, trust, and accountability in the food industry. The study further paves the way for future researchers to address the technological and people-related challenges in the Industry 4.0 era to mitigate the emerging problems in the food sector.

To cope with such a fast-changing environment, organisations have been steadily implementing different types of technologies, and at different stages. One of the most disruptive and promising technology is blockchain, and its potential to transform various aspects of organisations’ business and operations, including the supply chain relationships, is tremendous. In line with the global research trend in this domain, this paper proposes a multi-stage model of adoption (intention, adoption, and routinisation stages), for a better understanding of blockchain diffusion across supply chains. We drew on the diffusion of innovations theory, the resource-based view, dynamic capability, the technology adoption model, and the institutional theory to propose a multi-stage model. We validated the model using PLS-SEM, which was applied on data collected in India and the U.S. Our results showed that, from one country to another, there are essential differences in the variables that determine blockchain innovation and in the stage of diffusion.

In the battle against the outbreak of COVID-19, how to manage and share the COVID-19 Electric Medical Records (CEMRs) safely and effectively in the world, prevent malicious users from tampering with CEMRs, and protect the privacy of patients are very worthy of attention. In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. In this scheme, we perform the blockchain for uniform identity authentication and all public keys, revocation lists, etc are stored on a blockchain. The system manager server is responsible for generating the system parameters and publishes the private keys for the COVID-19 medical practitioners and users. The cloud service provider (CSP) stores the CEMRs and generates the intermediate decryption parameters using policy matching. The user can calculate the decryption key if the user has private keys and intermediate decrypt parameters. Only when attributes are satisfied access policy and the user's identity is out of the revocation list, the user can get the intermediate parameters by CSP. The malicious users may track according to the tracking list and can be directly revoked. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic medical records.; security and privacy protection; traceable and revocationBlockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Privacy by design; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Global public health; Medical data management; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Security and privacy issues; Security and privacy protection; Storage overhead; Data Sharing","非CCF推荐");

Therefore, a trust-based service management mechanism is required to secure information dissemination. The issue of how to achieve a trust management model becomes a key problem in the situation. This paper proposes a novel prototype of the decentralized trust management system (DTMS) based on blockchain technologies. Compared with the conventional and centralized trust management system, DTMS adopts a decentralized consensus-based trust evaluation model and a blockchain-based trust storage system, which provide a transparent evaluation procedure and irreversible storage of trust credits. Moreover, the proposed trust model improves blockchain efficiency by only allowing trusted nodes participating in the validation and consensus process. Additionally, the designed system creatively applies a trusted execution environment (TEE) to secure the trust evaluation process together with an incentive model that is used to stimulate more participation and penalize malicious behaviours.

Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised.

This article explores a promising solution for secure Digital Health Certificate, called NovidChain, a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving platform for COVID-19 test/vaccine certificates issuing and verifying. More precisely, NovidChain incorporates several emergent concepts: (i) Blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and immutability, (ii) self-sovereign identity to allow users to have complete control over their data, (iii) encryption of Personally Identifiable Information to enhance privacy, (iv) W3C verifiable credentials standard to facilitate instant verification of COVID-19 proof, and (v) selective disclosure concept to permit user to share selected pieces of information with trusted parties. Therefore, NovidChain is designed to meet a high level of protection of personal data, in compliant with the GDPR and KYC requirements, and guarantees the user's self-sovereignty, while ensuring both the safety of populations and the user's right to privacy.

Among them, phishing scams on blockchain have been found to make a notable amount of money, thus emerging as a serious threat to the trading security of the blockchain ecosystem. In order to create a favorable environment for investment, an effective method for detecting phishing scams is urgently needed in the blockchain ecosystem. To this end, this article proposes an approach to detect phishing scams on Ethereum by mining its transaction records. Specifically, we first crawl the labeled phishing addresses from two authorized websites and reconstruct the transaction network according to the collected transaction records. Then, by taking the transaction amount and timestamp into consideration, we propose a novel network embedding algorithm called trans2vec to extract the features of the addresses for subsequent phishing identification. Finally, we adopt the one-class support vector machine (SVM) to classify the nodes into normal and phishing ones. Experimental results demonstrate that the phishing detection method works effectively on Ethereum, and indicate the efficacy of trans2vec over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on feature extraction for transaction networks.

The problem of designing a secure federated learning framework to ensure the correctness of training procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains open. In this paper, we propose VFChain, a verifiable and auditable federated learning framework based on the blockchain system.

However, since the projects are planned, evaluated, and managed by different departments and institutions, duplicate planning and submission leads to insufficient sharing of research results. Currently, the National Technology Information Service (NTIS) inspects project duplication based on keywords, which leads to duplicate planning among departments and closed management of research results. Since the NTIS builds in centralized systems, the inspection systems supports one-way management for duplication checking and information sharing. Therefore, we propose a new platform, called the Trusted Information Project Platform (TIP-Platform), for easily checking for project duplication, sharing research results, and updating research results.

However, the wide deployment of IoT suffers certain issues as well, such as interoperability, compatibility, heterogeneity, large amount of data, processing of heterogeneous data etc. Among others, energy efficiency and security are the utmost prominent issues. Scarce computing resources of IoT devices put hindrances on information sharing across edge or IoT network. Indeed, unintentional or malicious interference with IoT data may lead to severe concerns. In this study, the researcher exploits the potential benefits of a blockchain system and integrates it with software-defined networking (SDN) while justifying energy and security issues. More in detail, the researcher proposed a new routing protocol with the cluster structure for IoT networks using blockchain-based architecture for SDN controller. The proposed architecture obviates proof-of-work (PoW) with private and public blockchains for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication between SDN controllers and IoT devices. In addition to this, distributed trust-based authentication mechanism makes blockchain even more adoptive for IoT devices with limited resources.

First is the identification of important decentralised hospital criteria which affect hospital evaluation to create a new dataset for this context. Second is the development of a new mHealth framework phase consequent of four development sequences: new integrated distance measurement through Haversine-based on GPS for time estimation for the convenient remote interaction with hospitals, combination for new hospital datasets and development of three decision matrixes based on a crossover of (1) healthcare service packages/time of arrival of patient at the hospital criteria and (2) lists of hospitals for evaluation and prioritisation using integration AHP-VIKOR techniques.

The first strategy matches between surplus power supply and demand of participants, while the second is based on the distance between them in the network. The impact of bilateral trading preferences on the price and amount of energy traded is assessed for the two strategies. A decentralized fully P2P energy trading market is developed to generate the results in a day-ahead setting. After that, a permissioned blockchain-smart contract platform is used for the implementation of the decentralized P2P trading market on a digital platform. Actual data from a residential neighborhood in the Netherlands, with different varieties of distributed energy resources, is used for the simulations. Results show that in the two strategies, the energy procurement cost and grid interaction of all participants in P2P trading are reduced compared to a baseline scenario. The total amount of P2P energy traded is found to be higher when the trading preferences are based on distance, which could also be considered as a proxy for energy efficiency in the network by encouraging P2P trading among nearby households. However, the P2P trading prices in this strategy are found to be lower. Further, a comparison is made between two scenarios: with and without electric heating in households.

Direct queries on the blockchain take much time by searching every block, while indirect queries on a blockchain database greatly degrade the authenticity of query results. To conquer the authenticity problem, we propose a Verifiable Query Layer (VQL) that can be deployed in the cloud to provide both efficient and verifiable data query services for blockchain systems. The middleware layer extracts data from the underlying blockchain system and efficiently reorganizes them in databases. To prevent falsified data from being stored in the middleware, a cryptographic fingerprint is calculated based on each constructed database. The database fingerprint will be first verified by miners and then written into the blockchain. Moreover, public users can verify the entire databases or several databases that interest them in the middleware layer. We implement VQL together with the verification schemes and conduct extensive experiments based on a practical blockchain system. The evaluation results demonstrate that VQL can efficiently support various data query services and guarantee the authenticity of query results for blockchain systems. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","blockchain systems; Cloud query service; data authenticity; verifiable queryAuthentication; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Distributed computer systems; Middleware; Peer to peer networks; Query languages; Query processing; Search engines; Block-chain; Blockchain system; Cloud query service; Data authenticity; Data query; Peer-to-peer computing; Query efficiency; Query results; Query service; Data mining","A");

Common challenges for designing such systems include prosumers' privacy and security threats. To this end, Blockchain-based solutions have gained a lot of attention, though most existing solutions have either employed permissionless blockchain, which is far from pragmatic for a P2P energy trading system with peers permitted to join or leave the network at their whim; or relatively secure yet inefficient permissioned blockchains. Hence, this article presents a flexible permissioned ascription (FPA) scheme that uses on-chain and off-chain permissioning scheme via Orion and Metamask wallet. It also employs contract permissioning through a JavaScript based chain code deployed over Hyperledger Besu (an Ethereum based permissioned Blockchain network) with istanbul byzantine fault tolerant (IBFT) 2.0 consensus algorithm. Additionally, the proposed framework is emulated for development of a working prototype for a P2P energy trading system. Its performance evaluation has been conducted and monitored with Grafana, Prometheus, Hyperledger Caliper, and Kibana for parameters such as latency, throughput, success rate, CPU time, block time, block behind time, memory usage, garbage collection (GC) time, and performance of the validator nodes. The latency of IBFT 2.0 was found five times lesser than that of Ethereum and two times lesser than HF RAFT and KAFKA under varying conditions. Also, the measured throughput was 1.5 times higher than RAFT and Kafka and three times higher than that of Ethereum. The average block confirmation time measured is 5-6 s. The GC usage measured very less, i.e., 0.5-0.8%, with the proposed framework. It has been observed that the proposed energy-trading framework provides an efficient performance for deploying, transferring, and querying the energy transaction to a P2P energy-trading Blockchain network when compared with other consensus mechanisms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; hyperledger besu; off-chain; on-chain permissioning; peer-to-peer energy tradingBlockchain; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Decentralized energy; Energy sector; Energy trading; Fault-tolerant capability; High securities; Hybrid framework; Performance bottlenecks; Security threats; Smart power grids","非CCF推荐");

Blockchain-based access control method has become a promising security technology, but it still faces high latency in consensus process and weak adaptability to dynamic changes in network environment. This article proposes a novel access control framework for 5G-enabled IIoT based on consortium blockchain. We design three types of chaincodes for the framework named policy management chaincode (PMC), access control chaincode (ACC), and credit evaluation chaincode (CEC). The PMC and ACC are deployed on the same data channel to implement the management of access control policies and the authorization of access. The CEC deployed on another channel is used to add behavior records collected from IIoT devices and calculate the credit value of IIoT domain. Specifically, we design a two-step credit-based Raft consensus mechanism, which can select the orderer nodes dynamically to achieve fast and reliable consensus based on historical behavior records stored in the ledger. Furthermore, we implement the proposed framework on a real-world testbed and compare it with the framework based on practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus. The experiment results show that our proposed framework can maintain lower consensus cost time with 100 ms level and achieves four to five times throughput with lower hardware resource consumption and communication consumption. Besides, our design also improves the security and robustness of the access control process. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","5G-enabled Industrial IoT; access control; consortium blockchain; credit evaluation5G mobile communication systems; Access control; Blockchain; Fault tolerance; Privacy by design; Process control; Access control policies; Byzantine fault tolerance; Control framework; Credit evaluations; Hardware resources; Policy management; Security and privacy; Security technology; Industrial internet of things (IIoT)","非CCF推荐");

However, it extends its underlying centralised architecture, which arouses various challenges correlated with network data availability, network information protection, and operational infrastructure charges. With the recent revolution of telecommunication, 5G networks promised to provide credible schemes like the high quality of service, ultra-low latency, and much security over the pre-existing architecture. However, the deployment of end-to-end 5G network cutting-edge systems in the present heterogeneous world limits its core idea of extensive data privacy, native interoperability, risk-free interference, and radio spectrum sharing. Perhaps, to achieve its true capability, improved versions of blockchain technology could be aligned to strengthen various real-time complex applications at a flourishing rate. One of the multiplexed real-time enterprise applications is a keyword search engine where the integrity of user data files and keyword searches are bound to come under cyber hackers. On the one hand, it was found that when a 5G-based blockchain emulated network gets deployed with intact encryption techniques, the entire system facilitates to give reliable, efficient, and risk-free keyword search over variegated 5G network data and its complex computational calculations. Consequently, the use of blockchain-based decentralised cloud orchestration scheme at various levels enabled the architecture to remain incorruptible and protects all the confidential files and keywords in a fully controlled file access environment.

They are immutable to change, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is critical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A Contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to find smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world smart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts.

The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, blockchain smart contracts are designed so as to provide a regulated solution to the need of patients, physicians, and health service providers. The proposed system aims to exchange health information on a blockchain platform to build a smart e-health system.

After the owner of some confidential data outsources the data to cloud storage services and shares it with others, the data owner lost the control to the data to a large extent. To achieve data sharing while keeping data confidentiality, attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be employed by cloud storage services. However, ABE can only guarantee that outsourced data on the cloud is decrypted by attribute-satisfying users but cannot restrict data from being accessed by dishonest users whose attributes also satisfy the access-control policy. It is impossible for the data owner to control the shared data after it has been decrypted by dishonest users, especially when a set of attribute-satisfying dishonest users may collude. To address this concern, we propose a traceable data sharing scheme called TraceChain. In TraceChain, data is encrypted over a new CP-ABE scheme called E-CP-ABE. Furthermore, the system parameters for generating the private key in E-CP-ABE are uploaded to the private blockchain and transactions are performed on the chain. The data owner can obtain the identity of users by monitoring system parameters simultaneously and control data sharing on the blockchain. To prove the security of our scheme, the security analysis is given in this paper.

Therefore, it provides a new challenge of data protection regarding reliability, integrity, and confidentiality because of outsourcing. As a result, cloud security is becoming a key differentiator and competitive edge between cloud providers. Nowadays, the use of blockchain in cloud computing is one of the most common innovations that can solve cloud computing security problems. Blockchain is a decentralized data management technology to provide security, anonymity, and data integrity without any third-party organization. This work presents a comprehensive study of cloud computing security concerns and blockchain solutions to address these concerns. Applying different filters and searching international databases, 21 articles from reputable journals are found and reviewed. We examine cloud security in three categories: data integration, trust, and privacy. The results show that blockchain provides a successful platform in this regard.

However, the limited battery power of mobile devices limits access to abundant data. To address this problem, an energy-efficient and secure algorithm should be introduced to reduce energy consumption for the MFBC. In this paper, an energy-efficient and secure hybrid (EESH) algorithm is introduced for the MFBC to support the IoT. The EESH algorithm uses the voltage scaling factor to reduce energy consumption. The performance of the EESH algorithm is substantially better than the state-of-the-art contending algorithms when the number of IoT-tasks increases, and EESH consumes minimal energy. Furthermore, the identity of mobile cloud users is of paramount significance; therefore, the EESH is further secured by applying a malicious data detection (MDD) algorithm using blockchain technology. The capability of the processors on the server side of the MFBC is analyzed and improved for the IoT. The proposed EESH, MDD and underlying algorithms are programmed on the Java platform.

Edge computing delivers real-time computations and communications for IoT devices by leveraging edge servers deployed close to users, which creates a collaborative edge computing (CEC) paradigm. The capacity of edge servers is beneficial but risky, as vulnerable servers can be exploited to conduct surveillance or perform other nefarious activities. Besides, fake IoT devices would bring security threats and compromise the IoT system. This highlights the necessity of designing a secure and efficient mutual authentication scheme for CEC. In this direction, related works have proposed various authentication mechanisms, but most of them are found unfit due to the absence of decentralization, anonymity, and mobility. Motivated by this fact, we propose a blockchain-based mutual authentication scheme that bridges these gaps. Specifically, blockchain, certificateless cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, and pseudonym-based cryptography are integrated into our scheme to provide mutual authentication between edge servers and IoT devices. Except for static conditions, both intraedge and interedge authentication are considered. Besides, we elaborate on the key generation procedures and design a session key negotiation mechanism.

Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools do not provide mechanisms to cope with the flexibility requirements inherent to open and dynamic collaboration environments. In particular, existing tools adopt a static role binding approach wherein roles are bound to actors upfront when a process instance is created. Also, these tools do not allow participants to collectively make choices regarding alternative sub-processes or branches in the process model, at runtime. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. Furthermore, the paper introduces a model for consensus-based control-flow flexibility, wherein participants in a process can collectively agree on how to steer the business process within the boundaries defined by control-flow agreement policies.

However, labour and energy consumption costs increase the production cost of the greenhouse by 40–50% approximately. Moreover, the security and authenticity of agriculture data, particularly for yield monitoring and analysis, is also a challenging issue in current greenhouse systems.The greenhouse require optimal parameter settings with controlled environment to produce increase food production. Therefore, slight advancement can bring remarkable improvements concerning the increase in production with reduced overall cost. In this work, we contributed blockchain enabled optimization approach for greenhouse system. The proposed approach works in three steps to provide optimal greenhouse environment that are; prediction, optimization, and finally controlling. Initially, the Kalman filter algorithm is employed for predicting the greenhouse sensor data. In next step, the optimal parameters are computed for the indoor greenhouse environment. Finally, the optimized parameters are utilized by the control module to operate and regulate the actuator's state to meet the desired settings in the indoor environment. To evaluate the performance of our proposed greenhouse system, we have developed an emulation tool. The proposed system has been investigated and compared against baseline approach concerning production rate and energy consumption. The obtained results reveal that the proposed optimization approach has improved the energy consumption by 19% against the prediction based approach and 41% against the Baseline scheme. Furthermore, the proof-of-concept based on the Hyperledger Fabric network is implemented on the top of the proposed greenhouse platform.

To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a decentralized and permissionless blockchain protocol, named Bychain. Specifically, 1) a privacy-preserving SRC protocol for activity-tracking and corresponding generalized block structure is developed, by connecting an interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol and the key escrow mechanism. As a result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain location information are decoupled. Meanwhile, the owner of the on-chain location data can still claim its ownership without revealing the private key to anyone else. 2) An artificial potential field-based incentive allocation mechanism is proposed to incentivize IoT witnesses to pursue the maximum monitoring coverage deployment.

We obtain the optimal prices and corresponding profits of the two retailers when applying and not applying blockchain, respectively, and find that consumer privacy concerns decline both retailers’ prices and profits when adopting blockchain technology because consumer privacy concerns lower consumers’ valuations of products, thereby reducing demand. Furthermore, we analyze the two retailers’ equilibrium strategies of the application of blockchain technology, which suggests that it is not always beneficial for retailers to adopt blockchain technology in all situations. Both retailers will apply blockchain only when consumer privacy concerns are lower and information transparency promotion is higher because higher information transparency promotion increases consumers’ willingness to pay, which exceeds the cost of consumers privacy concerns. On the contrary, when consumer privacy concerns are higher and information transparency promotion is lower, neither retailer will apply blockchain technology. Interestingly, when both consumer privacy concerns and information transparency promotion are medium, the initial retailer will apply blockchain technology and the entrant retailer will not because consumers’ higher trust in initial retailer allows the initial retailer can bear higher cost of consumers privacy concerns which is hard to undertake for the new entrant retailer when information transparency promotion is medium. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain technology; Customer privacy; Game theory; Retailer competition; Supply chain managementBlockchain; Competition; Costs; Data privacy; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Transparency; AM medium; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Consumer privacy; Customer privacy; Information transparency; Price competition; Privacy concerns; Product information; Retailer competitions; Game theory","非CCF推荐");

However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB's resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto's attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW. © 2014 IEEE.","Bidirectional blockchain; double-spend attack; eclipse attack; Internet of Things (IoT); long-range attack; scalabilityBig data; Blockchain; Denial-of-service attack; Hash functions; Learning systems; Losses; Network security; Scalability; Systems engineering; Bidirectional blockchain; Block-chain; Committee members; Consensus algorithms; Double-spend attack; Eclipse attack; High scalabilities; Internet of thing; Long-range attack; Proof of work; Internet of things","非CCF推荐");

With frequent data transaction and rewards distribution in the crowdsensing process, how to design an integrated scheme which guarantees the privacy of AVs and enables the ECDs to earn rewards securely while minimizing the task execution cost (TEC) therefore becomes a challenge. To this end, in this article, we develop a blockchain-based collaborative crowdsensing (BCC) scheme to support secure and efficient vehicular crowdsensing in AVNs. In the BCC, by considering the potential attacks in the crowdsensing process, we first develop a secure crowdsensing environment by designing a blockchain-based transaction architecture to deal with privacy and security issues. With the designed architecture, we then propose a coalition game with a transferable reward to motivate AVs to cooperatively execute the crowdsensing tasks by jointly considering the requirements of the tasks and the available sensing resources of AVs. After that, based on the merge and split rules, a coalition formation algorithm is designed to help each ECD select a group of AVs to form the optimal crowdsensing coalition (OCC) with the target of minimizing the TEC. Finally, we evaluate the TEC of the task and the rewards of the ECDs by comparing the proposed scheme with other schemes. The results show that our scheme can lead to a lower TEC for completing crowdsensing tasks and bring higher rewards to ECDs than the conventional schemes. © 2014 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs); blockchain; coalition game; vehicular crowdsensingBlockchain; Electrochromic devices; Network architecture; Coalition formations; Computing devices; Conventional schemes; Data transaction; Potential attack; Privacy and security; Transaction architectures; Vehicular networks; Privacy by design","非CCF推荐");

In particular, proof-of-authentication utilizing a lightweight authenticated encryption (AE) scheme to achieve consensus is proposed. At sensor nodes, a tag is generated based on sensor data, which is then broadcast to the network. Upon authentication from the cluster head node (e.g., a gateway), the block is hashed using the lightweight hash function and added to the blockchain. The proposed solution can be implemented in software (e.g., microcontroller) or hardware platform (e.g., FPGA, ASIC).

The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-And-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and bloXroute servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms.

This fit earns the Federal Office's project considerable credit and traction with stakeholders and partner authorities – not least because it supports the argument that the digitalization of federal systems is possible without ‘digital centralization’ and redistribution of competencies. Our task-technology fit analysis contributes to a better understanding of the adoption of blockchain in the public sector. It also provides the foundation for an extended task-technology fit theory for federally structured, cross-organizational contexts. © 2022 The Authors","Blockchain; Federalism; Organizing principles; Public sector; Task-technology fitBlock-chain; Cross-organizational; Digital technologies; Driving forces; Federalism; Organizing principle; Public sector; Public services; Task technology fit; Technology selection","非CCF推荐");

This paper proposes a lightweight dynamic asynchronous algorithm considering the averaging frequency control and parameter selection for federated learning to speed up model averaging and improve efficiency, which enables federated learning to adaptively remove the stragglers with low computing power, bad channel conditions, or anomalous parameters. In addition, a novel local reliability mutual evaluation mechanism is presented to enhance the security of poisoning attacks, which enables federated learning to detect the anomalous parameter of poisoning attacks and adjust the weight proportion of in model aggregation based on evaluation score.

In response to the above, this paper proposes a framework for 5G-secure-smart healthcare monitoring (5GSS) to achieve the following goals: fast and accurate identification of context-aware health situation, blockchain-based secure data sharing, and low-latency services for emergent patients. The framework consists of a data acquisition layer, a diagnosis and security layer (edge cloud), and a health service layer. The proposed framework adopts the following key technologies: a 5G-IPv6 communication network, context-aware health situation identification-based similarity measure, and blockchain-based secure data sharing mechanism.

Incentive and trust are the two main challenges in facilitating collaborative edge storage. This article proposes CSEdge, a novel decentralized system that tackles these challenges to enable collaborative edge storage based on blockchain.

Steganography embeds the data that needs to be shared into digital carrier files and transmits it through open channels, which has important applications in protecting data sharing and realizing covert communication. However, the encrypted files generated by traditional steganography are susceptible to compression, cropping, geometric attacks, and man-made destruction in the process of open channel transmission, resulting in data loss, making it difficult for the receiver to correctly extract secret message. Currently, covert communication on blockchain can solve the above problems, but it also brings some new problems such as high computational complexity, low transmission efficiency, and nondetection resistance. Therefore, in this article, a covert communication method based on Bitcoin transactions is proposed. The proposed method first designs the index matrix of the transaction address. Then, the address interaction relationship that carries the secret message through the transaction index matrix is constructed. Finally, the address interaction relationship that carries the secret message is combined with the transaction amount to complete the covert transmission of the secret message on the blockchain environment. The proposed method improves the security and embedding efficiency of covert communication, reduces the number of transactions, and ensures the integrity of extracting secret message.

This research, therefore, contributes to filling the gap by carrying out an SLR of contemporary research studies in the area of RFID applications in supply chains. To date, SLR augmented with BA has not been used to study the developments in RFID applications in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: We analyze 556 articles from years 2001 to date using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Contemporary bibliometric analysis (BA) tools are utilized. First, an exploratory analysis is carried, out revealing influential authors, sources, regions, among other key aspects. Second, a co-citation work analysis is utilized to understand the conceptual structure of the literature, followed by a dynamic co-citation network to reveal the evolution of the field. This is followed by a multivariate analysis is performed on top-100 cited papers, and k-means clustering is carried out to find optimal groups and identify research themes. The influential themes are then pointed out using factor analysis. Findings: An exploratory analysis is carried out using BA tools to provide insights into factors such as influential authors, production countries, top-cited papers and frequent keywords. Visualization of bibliographical data using co-citation network analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis assisted in understanding the groups (communities) of research themes. We employed k-means clustering and factor analysis methods to further develop these insights. A historiographical direct citation analysis also unveils potential research directions. We observe that RFID applications in the supply chain are likely to benefit from the Internet of Things and blockchain Technology along with the other machine learning and visualization approaches. Originality/value: Although several researchers have researched RFID literature in relation to supply chains, these reviews are often conducted in the traditional manner where the author(s) select paper based on their area of expertise, interest and experience. Limitation of such reviews includes authors’ selection bias of studies to be included and limited or no use of advanced BA tools for analysis. This study fills this research gap by conducting an SLR of RFID in supply chains to identify important research trends in this field through the use of advanced BA tools. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; Clustering; Cocitation analysis; Factor analysis; Multivariate analysis; Network analysis; RFID; Supply chain; Systematic literature review","非CCF推荐");

Existing traditional access-control systems provide security and management to the IoT system. However, these mechanisms are based on central authority management, which introduces issues such as a single point of failure, low scalability, and a lack of privacy. In order to address these problems, many researchers have proposed using blockchain technology to achieve decentralized access control. However, such models are still faced with problems such as a lack of scalability and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a light-weight hierarchical blockchain-based multi-chaincode access control to protect the security and privacy of IoT systems. A clustering concept with BC managers enables the extended scalability of the proposed system. The architecture of the proposed solution contains three main components: an Edge Blockchain Manager (EBCM), which is responsible for authenticating and authorizing constrained devices locally; an Aggregated Edge Blockchain Manager (AEBCM), which contains various EBCMs to control different clusters and manage ABAC policies, and a Cloud Consortium Blockchain Manager (CCBCM), which ensures that only authorized users access the resources. In our solution, smart contracts are used to self-enforce decentralized AC policies. We implement a proof of concept for our proposed system using the permissioned Hyperledger Fabric.

These barriers impede the implementation of CE; however, research to address them is ongoing. For example, novel technologies have become a key enabler for easing the impact of CE adoption barriers. Blockchain is one disruptive technology that has the potential to address some of those barriers, notably technological, organizational, and ecological. Blockchain is particularly well suited to help address supply chain-oriented barriers to CE adoption. However, a review of the literature shows that while there are a limited number of conceptual studies that address the capabilities of blockchain to alleviate the impact of the barriers to CE, no previous study has focused on this vital subject using a decision tool based on expert data.

To address the problem, we propose zkrpChain, which focuses on protection of the integrity and privacy of the data uploaded by blockchain members while leaving their identities public. In zkrpChain, which is based on Hyperledger Fabric and Bulletproofs, both standard-range and arbitrary-range zero-knowledge range proofs generation and verification are supported. To improve the efficiency, the aggregation of multiple proofs and batch verification are developed. Furthermore, to broaden the application scenarios, we also develop multi-party proofs generation and verification. To support further development, we provide chaincodes, related APIs together with the client codes.

This article puts forward a new proposal of devising a security and privacy-preserving design mechanism of data transactions in educational microservices leveraging the blockchain technology. The design comprises three phases, namely the blockchain framework, data sending-receiving, and confidentiality-integrity-availability over a secured platform with each phase having detailed mechanisms for algorithm implementation. The proposal is shown to exhibit favorable performance in terms of time cost of publishing, throughput, and latency, and shown to have high survey acceptance in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability with approximately 10% improvement from prior blockchain adoption. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; data handling; education; industry 4.0; microservices; securityBlockchain; Electronic data interchange; Industry 4.0; Network security; Algorithm implementation; Cyber defense; Data transaction; Design mechanisms; Education industry; Educational attainments; Elasticity characteristics; Security and privacy; Privacy by design","非CCF推荐");

Astraea protocols are decentralized oracle designs utilizing majority-voting mechanism to determine the oracle outcomes and/or rewards to voters. However, the voters are indifferent between voting through a single or multiple identities, as the potential rewards by the decentralized oracles grow linearly with the voters stakes. Additionally, the majority-voting mechanism may facilitate herd behaviors among the voters, as the voters are rewarded only if they are in agreement with the majority outcomes. In this paper, a novel oracle protocol is introduced by proposing a peer prediction-based scoring scheme along with non-linear staking rules, aiming at extracting subjective data truthfully. Specifically, an incentive compatible scoring scheme is designed so that voters uniquely maximize their expected score by honest reporting. The voters are rewarded when their report achieves a relatively high score compared to the rest of the voters, as opposed to the existing schemes, where a reward is only given when they agree to the majority. Furthermore, a non-linear stake scaling rule is proposed to discourage Sybil attacks. Detailed simulation results are presented to show the operation of the proposed oracle protocol and its improvement compared to indicative mechanisms proposed in the existing literature. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Computer applications; Computer networks; External informations; Herd behaviors; Incentive compatible; Majority voting mechanism; Multiple identities; Potential rewards; Prediction-based; Scoring schemes; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Blockchain is a good potential solution, however, the Nakamoto consensus-based scheme has a low spectrum utilization rate, high transaction delay, and a huge waste of energy. In this paper, we present a novel decentralized distributed spectrum trading protocol STBC (Spectrum Trading Blockchain) base on blockchain, which explicitly aims for efficiency, simplicity, safety, and energy-saving. STBC uses a new consensus mechanism to quickly confirm transactions while tolerating up to n/3 malicious nodes (n is the total number of nodes), and its implementation code is very concise. We adopt the similar idea of sharding to improve the efficiency and scalability of the system. Due to the specificality of spectrum trading, it is necessary to protect the privacy of trading nodes. Therefore we propose a temporarily anonymous transaction that can effectively prevent DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack. Moreover, theoretical analysis shows that STBC is also secure against mainstream attacks such as double-spending attacks and the power consumption of STBC is significantly less than the Nakamoto consensus-based scheme. The prototype evaluation of our protocol demonstrates that it improves the spectrum utilization by about 30% compared with the state-of-the-art blockchain spectrum trading schemes, and meanwhile reducing the transaction confirmation delay by about 12.5x. © 2015 IEEE.","Blockchain; distributed consensus algorithm; spectrum management; spectrum trading5G mobile communication systems; Blockchain; Commerce; Denial-of-service attack; Energy conservation; Internet of things; Network security; Anonymous transaction; Distributed denial of service; Internet of Things (IOT); Malicious nodes; Spectrum trading; Spectrum utilization; State of the art; Fintech","非CCF推荐");

How to achieve a secure and efficient data-sharing scheme for the consumer IoT applications is a huge challenge for us. The traditional cloud-based IoT has the dilemma of prolonged communication delay and privacy leakage. With the application of 5G technology, edge computing can effectively alleviate these problems. However, it cannot meet the higher security requirements for the data sources authenticity and information reliability. By combining the blockchain and smart contracts technology, this article proposes a distributed, efficient, and secure data-sharing scheme centered on consumer IoT devices. This architecture consists of four layers: 1) IoT devices layer, 2) edge storage layer, 3) blockchain network layer, and 4) application services layer. We design smart contracts based on the attributed based access control and the searchable encryption algorithm, including device retrieval contract, policy management contract, and authorization verification contract.

It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected person during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine. However, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency issues. To address these limitations, in this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of depending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health authorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of failure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all transactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system consists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public places access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control subsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones. Our analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy of the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system (which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation, and storage overheads. © 2014 IEEE.","Contact tracing; COVID-19; infection control; privacy preservation; securityBlockchain; Control systems; Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Privacy by design; Viruses; Control subsystems; Existing systems; Incubation periods; Infection control; Integrated subsystems; Privacy preserving; Storage overhead; Tracking attacks; Access control","非CCF推荐");

The increased use of an efficient forecasting mechanism for the agriculture information management of generated records and processing creates emerging challenges and limitations. These include new government mandates and regulations, the price of land for expansion, forecasting the growing demand for commodities, fluctuations in the global financial market, food security, and bio-based fuels. Building and deploying distributed dynamic scheduling, management, and monitoring systems of agricultural activities for commodity price forecasting and supply chains require a significant secure and efficient approach. Thus, this paper discusses a collaborative approach where two different folds are demonstrated to cover distinct aspects with different objectives. A metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm is designed to receive day-to-day agricultural production details and process and analyze forecast pricing from the records by scheduling, managing, and monitoring them in real-time. The blockchain hyperledger sawtooth distributed modular technology provides a secure communication channel between stakeholders, a private network, protects the forecasting ledger, adds and updates commodity prices, and preserves agricultural information and node transactions in the immutable ledger (IPFS). To accomplish this, we design, develop, and deploy two distinct smart contracts to register the system’s actual stakeholders and allow for the addition of node transactions and exchanges. The second smart contract updates the forecasting commodity pricing ledger and distributes it to participating stakeholders while preserving detailed addresses in storage. The simulation results of the proposed collaborative approach deliver an efficient E-agriculture commodity price forecast with an accuracy of 95.3%.

However, such multi-source heterogenous data typically contain low-quality data, e.g., missing values, which may result in potential risks. Besides, resource-constrained devices incur large latency in edge computing networks. To alleviate such latency, distributed task offloading schemes are designed to share the computation burden between edge nodes and nearby servers. However, there are three main drawbacks of such schemes. First, low-quality data are not carefully evaluated by constraints under scenarios, which may result in slow convergence in distributed computation. Second, multi-source data including sensitive information are computed and shared among edge nodes without privacy protection. Third, distributed tasks on low-quality data may result in low-quality results even with an optimal offloading scheme. To address the problems above, a task offloading framework for edge computing based on consortium blockchain and distributed reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which can provide high-quality task offloading policies with data privacy protected.

Although distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) could provide such a platform, blockchains, such as Bitcoin, were not designed with IoT networks in mind, hence are often unsuitable for such applications: they offer poor transaction throughput and confirmation times, put stress on constrained computing and storage resources, and require high transaction fees. In this article, we consider a class of IoT-friendly DLTs based on directed acyclic graphs, rather than a blockchain, and with a reputation system in the place of Proof of Work (PoW). However, without PoW, the implementation of these DLTs requires an access control algorithm to manage the rate at which nodes can add new transactions to the ledger. We model the access control problem and present an algorithm that is fair, efficient, and secure. Our algorithm represents a new design paradigm for DLTs in which concepts from networking are applied to the DLT setting for the first time. For example, our algorithm uses distributed rate setting, which is similar in nature to transmission control used in the Internet. However, our solution features novel adaptations to cope with the adversarial environment of DLTs in which no individual agent can be trusted. Our algorithm guarantees utilization of resources, consistency, fairness, and resilience against attackers. All of these are achieved efficiently and with regard for the limitations of IoT devices. We perform extensive simulations to validate these claims. © 2021 IEEE.","Access control; Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Internet of Things; Peer-to-peer computing; Quality of service; ThroughputAccess control; Blockchain; Directed graphs; Trusted computing; Adversarial environments; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Extensive simulations; Internet of thing (IOT); Reputation systems; Storage resources; Transaction throughput; Transmission control; Internet of things","非CCF推荐");

The rapidly increasing blockchain forks have resulted in fierce competition and created significant controversies in blockchain community. To analyze this competitive aspect, we consider blockchain as a two-sided platform that serves both customers and miners. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate how a blockchain platform's decision on its settings, such as block size and transaction fee, affects the competition between blockchain platforms as well as the participation behavior of customers and miners. Our findings suggest that increasing the transaction fee alleviates congestion on the platform when customers have a relatively balanced need between efficiency and safety. In contrast, it induces congestion when efficiency is valued over safety. In addition, under hard fork competition, the difference in blockchain platforms' block sizes directs the attention of miners towards different types of mining rewards. Moreover, it also affects the optimal types of customers the blockchain platforms should target.

As millions of devices are connected over the internet, security becomes a more challenging issue in the Cloud-IoT environment. Many research works have contributed to ensuring security in Cloud-IoT. But none of the works has proven its security strength and efficiency. In particular, centralized authentication and complex encryption schemes increase the overhead even for low-level security. This paper proposes a novel Decentralized Blockchain-based Security (DeBlock-Sec) scheme, which is most suitable for resource-constrained IoT environment to abridge the security issue. The overall system works upon three significant phases, (1) authentication phase, (2) data encryption phase, and (3) data retrieval phase. For authentication, we propose a novel Decentralized Blockchain-based Authentication (DBA) protocol. The DBA protocol uses multiple factors to authenticate users and devices. In the next phase, data encryption is carried on the IoT devices. As the amount of data to be encrypted is large in size, the encryption is performed in the spark environment since the confidentiality of data is vital. The data retrieval phase allows users to access the data stored in the Cloud. Dendrimer Fractal Tree Indexing is followed to minimize the searching time and the Revised Diffie-Hellman algorithm is presented for key exchange. The extensive experiments performed in Spark environment show that the proposed work achieves better performance in terms of time consumption (encryption, decryption and search), storage space, and throughput.

Since its inception, the traditional static network infrastructure-based solutions involve manual configuration and proprietary controls of networked devices. It then leads to improper utilization of the overall resources, and hence experiences various security threats. Although transport layer security (TLS)-based solution is presently advocated in the said framework, it is vulnerable to many security threats like man-in-the-middle, replay, spoofing, privileged insider, impersonation, and denial-of-service attacks. Moreover, the current settings of the said tool do not facilitate any secure and reliable mechanisms for data forwarding, application flow routing, new configuration deployment, and network event management. Also, it suffers from the single point of controller failure issue. In this article, we propose a new private blockchain-enabled fine-grained access control mechanism for the SDN environment. In this regard, attribute-based encryption (ABE) and certificate-based access control protocol are incorporated. This proposed solution can resist several well-known security threats, and alleviate different system-level inconveniences.

This adoption in virtually every device had made them smart, thereby reducing the human intervention to handle them. These devices become smart by gathering the sensed information and communicating with other devices or servers to take the appropriate decisions based on acquired data. However, these devices are deployed in batches with default usernames and passwords, making them vulnerable to attacks as seen in recent pasts like the Mirai botnet attack. Most of the attacks could have been avoided if these devices were equipped with a decent lightweight secure authentication scheme. One of the most common authentication procedures is using traditional public key infrastructure (PKI), which suffers from a single point of failure. Moreover, the complex procedures of PKI make them unfit for low-powered IoT devices. Identity-based cryptography (IBC), a lightweight cryptosystem, could be a good fit for these devices. But, even IBC suffers from a single point of failure and key escrow problem because of the private key generator (PKG).

Despite the benefits, security, energy constraining, insufficient training data are the major issues which need to be resolved in the IoT enabled medical field. To accomplish the security, blockchain technology is recently developed which is a decentralized architecture that is widely utilized. With this motivation, this paper introduces a new blockchain with DL enabled secure medical data transmission and diagnosis (BDL-SMDTD) model. The goal of the BDL-SMDTD model is to securely transmit the medical images and diagnose the disease with maximum detection rate. The BDL-SMDTD model incorporates different stages of operations such as image acquisition, encryption, blockchain, and diagnostic process. Primarily, moth flame optimization (MFO) with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), called MFO-ECC technique is used for the image encryption process where the optimal keys of ECC are generated using MFO algorithm. Besides, blockchain technology is utilized to store the encrypted images. Then, the diagnostic process involves histogram-based segmentation, Inception with ResNet-v2-based feature extraction, and support vector machine (SVM)-based classification.

In the proposed scheme, the model parameters are shared such that the screened medical data is modeled and analyzed based on federated learning, which allows more people to enjoy top medical resources. In addition, a blockchain-based incentive mechanism is used to reward medical institutions which are either honest with high-quality or helpful in decryption.

There is rapid growth importance in integrating both technologies into effective and stable information exchange and research solutions. Blockchain is a revolutionary platform for future generational telecommunications networking that will set up the secured and distributed information exchange framework. In combination with DRL, blockchain could significantly improve the efficiency of mobile communications. The rapid growth of networks for the Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates the development of suitable and reliable infrastructure as well as a significant proportion of the information. Blockchain, a distributed and reliable ledger, is often considered a considerably beneficial means of providing scientific confidentiality and security to IoT devices. When interacting with massive IoT records, the Blockchain’s decrease becomes a significant issue. Thus, it is necessary to improve transaction performance and deal with massive data transmission situations. As a result, the work presented here explores the DRL fundamental operation of the blockchain-enabled IoT system, where transactions are simultaneously strengthened, and community-based divisibility is ensured.

The current SAS paradigm prescribed by the FCC for the CBRS band and standardized by the WInnForum follows a centralized service model in that a spectrum user subscribes to a SAS server for spectrum allocation service. This model, however, neither tolerates SAS server failures (crash or Byzantine) nor resists dishonest SAS administrators, leading to serious concerns about SAS system reliability and trustworthiness. This is especially concerning for the evolving DSS landscape where an increasing number of SAS service providers and heterogeneous user requirements are coming up. To address these challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized SAS architecture called BD-SAS that provides SAS services securely and efficiently, without relying on the trust of each individual SAS server for the overall system trustworthiness. In BD-SAS, a global blockchain (G-Chain) is used for spectrum regulatory compliance while smart contract-enabled local blockchains (L-Chains) are instantiated in individual spectrum zones for automating spectrum access assignment per user request. We hope our vision of a decentralized SAS, the BD-SAS architecture, and discussion on future challenges can open up a new direction toward reliable spectrum management in a decentralized manner.

The exchange of information among vehicle nodes is critical due to the rapid and changing topologies, high mobility of nodes, and unpredictable network conditions. Finding a single trusted entity to store and distribute messages among vehicle nodes is also a challenging task. IoV is exposed to various security and privacy threats such as hijacking and unauthorized location tracking of smart vehicles. Traceability is an increasingly important aspect of vehicular communication to detect and penalize malicious nodes. Moreover, achieving both privacy and traceability can also be a challenging task. To address these challenges, this paper presents a blockchain‐based efficient, secure, and anonymous conditional privacy‐preserving and authentication mechanism for IoV networks. This solution is based on blockchain to allow vehicle nodes with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their data during the data communication and voting process. The proposed secure scheme provides conditional privacy to the users and the vehicles. To ensure anonymity, traceability, and unlinkability of data sharing among vehicles, we utilize Hyperledger Fabric to establish the blockchain.

The proposed scheme examines and evaluates different consensus algorithms used in the blockchain and anonymization techniques to preserve privacy.

The authentication of ANs and SNs is performed in public and private blockchains, respectively. However, inauthentic nodes utilize the network’s resources and perform malicious activities. Moreover, the SNs have limited energy, transmission range and computational capabilities, and are attacked by malicious nodes. Afterwards, the malicious nodes transmit wrong information of the route and increase the number of retransmissions due to which the SNs’ energy is rapidly consumed. The lifespan of the wireless sensor network is reduced due to the rapid energy dissipation of the SNs. Furthermore, the throughput increases and packet loss increase with the presence of malicious nodes in the network. The trust values of SNs are computed to eradicate the malicious nodes from the network. Secure routing in the network is performed considering residual energy and trust values of the SNs.

However, the current SCM systems are insufficient to provide product legitimacy, transaction privacy, and security. Therefore, this research proposes a secure SCM system for the authenticity of the products based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology. The IoT-enabled Quick Response (QR) scanner and the blockchain-integrated distributed system will allow all the SCM stakeholders to begin secure and private transactions for their products or services. Resulting, the consumer will receive an authentic and genuine product from the original producer. A lightweight asymmetric key encryption technique, i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain technology with on-chain smart contracts are applied for distributed IoT devices to make the authentication process faster and lighter. Each SCM stakeholder is registered by the service provider and receives corresponding public and private keys, which will be used for the authentication process of the participants and IoT devices. The authenticated QR scanner records all transactions on the blockchain. Consequently, there will be no human intervention for the SCM transactions. The security and scalability analysis demonstrates that the proposed system is more secure and robust than other state-of-the-art techniques. © 2022 by the authors.

The Ubiquitous use of tiny devices and embedded sensor frameworks has pushed IoT to the forefront of emerging technologies used in many applications like peer-to-peer networks, smart energy grids, home and building automation, vehicle to vehicle communication, and wearable computing devices. This massive growth and extensive use brought forth security risks that could hinder its commencement in many novel applications. The number of interconnected devices leads the way to several entry points for intruders and, along with it, security risks. The sensitive nature of the IoT applications such as health, automation, and energy grids cannot afford security risks. Traditional security mechanisms will not design or develop to secure such an emerging technology as IoT. Existing technologies have to be relied on with the non-existence of security mechanisms for this purpose. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one such technology that can reduce the security risks in IoT. The central node vulnerability that can compromise the whole system can be mitigated by eliminating the need for a central node by using the distributed ledger. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, has attracted tremendous attention and harnessed in itself a real-world value. However, computationally costly with limited scalability is not entirely suited for the IoT environment. IoT Application (IOTA) technology is the distributed ledger technology that can provide unlimited scalability specifically suitable for the IoT industry. This survey provides an in-depth introduction to how blockchain performs and its constraints in its nature as a generic platform for DLT.

The IoT has shown wide adoption in various applications including smart cities, healthcare, trade, business, etc. Among these applications, fitness applications have been widely considered for smart fitness systems. The users of the fitness system are increasing at a high rate thus the gym providers are constantly extending the fitness facilities. Thus, scheduling such a huge number of requests for fitness exercise is a big challenge. Secondly, the user fitness data is critical thus securing the user fitness data from unauthorized access is also challenging. To overcome these issues, this work proposed a blockchain-based load-balanced task scheduling approach. A thorough analysis has been performed to investigate the applications of IoT in the fitness industry and various scheduling approaches. The proposed scheduling approach aims to schedule the requests of the fitness users in a load-balanced way that maximize the acceptance rate of the users’ requests and improve resource utilization. The performance of the proposed task scheduling approach is compared with the state-of-the-art approaches concerning the average resource utilization and task rejection ratio. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheduling approach. For investigating the performance of the blockchain, various experiments are performed using the Hyperledger Caliper concerning latency, throughput, resource utilization. The Solo approach has shown an improvement of 32% and 26% in throughput as compared to Raft and Solo-Raft approaches respectively.

The cell pattern of Synovial Sarcoma (SS) cancer images always appeared as spindle shaped cell (SSC) structures. Identifying the SSC and its prognostic indicator are very crucial problems for computer aided diagnosis, especially in healthcare industry applications. A constructive framework has been proposed for the classification of SSC feature components using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the assistance of relevant Support Vectors (SVs). This framework used the SS images, and it has been transformed into frequency subbands using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The sub-band wavelet coefficients of SSC and other Structure Features (SF) are extracted using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) techniques. Here, the maximum and minimum margin between hyperplane values of the kernel parameters are adjusted periodically as a result of storing the SF values of the SVs in the IoT devices. The performance characteristics of internal cross-validation and its statistical properties are evaluated by cross-entropy measures and compared by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The significant differences in classification performance between the techniques are analyzed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The combination of QDA + SVM technique will be required for intelligent cancer diagnosis in the future, and it gives reduced statistic parameter feature set with greater classification accuracy.

Since conventional energy supply is still needed to help fill the gap between local demand and supply when the local solar generation is not sufficient, demand-response management will keep playing an important role in the future P2P energy market. Blockchain and smart contract technology has gained increasing attention in P2P trading for its secure operation. The performance of blockchain-based P2P energy trading still remains to be improved, in terms of latency and cost of computation resources. This article studies the challenges of demand-response management in P2P energy trading and proposes a blockchain-empowered energy trading system for a community-based P2P market. The proposed demand-response mechanism is developed using two noncooperative games, in which dynamic pricing is applied for suppliers. The proposed energy trading system is prototyped on a cluster network, with a coordinator running as a smart contract in a Hyperledger blockchain. We implemented both on-chain and off-chain processing modes to study the system performance. The results from experiments with our prototype indicate that our proposed demand-response games have a great effect on reducing the net peak load, and at the same time, the off-chain processing mode provides lower latency and overhead compared to the on-chain mode while still keeping the same system integrity as the on-chain mode. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; demand response; off-chain processing; peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading; smart contractBlockchain; Chains; Computer games; Costs; Game theory; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Block-chain; Demand response; Energy trading; Game; Off-chain processing; Peer to peer (P2P); Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading; Peer-to-peer computing; Smart contract.; Systems performance; Distributed ledger; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

The potential benefits of P2P energy trading can be realized through an efficient service provider of the communication network infrastructure. However, the current communication network is a trustless environment and thereby is unable to fully support the P2P energy trading requirements.

RPL has inherent security features to restrict external attacks. However, internal attacks in the IoT environment have continued to grow due to the lack of mechanisms to manage the secure identities and credentials of the billions of heterogeneous IoT devices. Weak credentials aid attackers in gaining access to IoT devices and further exploiting vulnerabilities stemming from the underlying routing protocols. Routing attacks degrade the performance of IoT networks by compromising the network resources, topology, and traffic. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework for the prediction of routing attacks in RPL-based IoT. The framework leverages Graph Convolution Network-based network embedding to capture and learn the latent state of the nodes in the IoT network. It uses a Long Short Term Memory model to predict network traffic. The framework incorporates a Feedforward Neural Network that uses network embedding and traffic prediction as input to predict routing attacks. The accuracy of any learning model depends on the integrity of the data provided to it as input. Therefore, the framework uses smart contract-fortified blockchain technology to establish secure channels for IoT data access. The smart contract within the blockchain generates warning impulses in the case of abnormal behavior of nodes. The framework predicts normal scenarios, resource attack scenarios, traffic attack scenarios, and topological attack scenarios with a fair accuracy of 94.5%, 82.46%, 91.88%, and 86.13%, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","IoT; Network embeddings; Routing attacks; RPL; Smart contractBlockchain; Embeddings; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Low power electronics; Network routing; Routing protocols; Topology; Abnormal behavior; Holistic frameworks; Internet of thing (IOT); Network embedding; Network resource; Security features; Short term memory; Traffic prediction; Internet of things","非CCF推荐");

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an effective solution to alleviating the problem via task offloading. In the mining process, miners compete for rewards through puzzle solving, where only the miner that first completes the process will be rewarded. Thus, miners may wish to pay higher price and use more communication resources in task offloading and more computation resources in task processing for latency reduction. However, there are risks for the miners not profiting from consuming more resources or paying a higher price, so miners are rational in blockchain systems. In order to maximize the rational total profit of all miners, we use an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the resource pricing and allocation, considering the stochastic properties of wireless channels, and the prospect theory is employed to strike a good balance between risks and rewards. Numerical results show that our proposed A3C based joint optimization algorithm converges fast and outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the total reward. © 2013 IEEE.","Asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C); blockchain; deep reinforcement learning; mobile edge computing; pricing; resource allocationBlockchain; Computation theory; Costs; Learning algorithms; Miners; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Communication resources; Computation intensives; Computation resources; Effective solution; Joint optimization; Processing capability; Reinforcement learning approach; Stochastic properties; Deep learning","非CCF推荐");

Existing work on blockchain deanonymization mainly focuses on Bitcoin that supports simple transactions of cryptocurrencies. As the popularity of decentralized application (DApp) platform blockchains with Turing-complete smart contracts, represented by Ethereum, identity inference in blockchain faces new challenges because of user diversity and complexity of activities enabled by smart contracts.

A distinction is made between two forms: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. It is believed that there are around 415 million people between the ages of 20 and 79 worldwide who have some form of diabetes illness today. In Europe, over 60 million people are diabetic, a diabetes incidence of 10.3% of men and 9.6% of women is estimated. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing among all ages in the European Region, mainly due to increases in overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. A huge people in this population have type 2 diabetes, and the numbers will continue to rise over the next few years. So one can speak of a real widespread disease. The problem is not only the increased blood sugar, but also complications and accompanying diseases such as heart attack, stroke, or diabetic foot. However, as a type 2 diabetic, we can significantly influence the course of the disease and the success of therapy. To do this, it is important that we early detect the person that have (or likely have) a serious problem or an emergent case, and know about it as fast as possible. Early detection and treatment of this disease are very important to help diabetics live a healthy and near normal life. It can also help to avoid several serious complications. In addition, the evolution of wearable and Internet of Things medical devices can help to collect various health data for diagnosis using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present an IoT-based system architecture which ensures the collection of patient data in order to predict serious cases of diabetes. To secure data, Blockchain and IPFS are used, and to analyze data, we propose a statistical-based method for predictions. The process is as follows. First, data were collected from IoT devices, and a dataset was constructed and stored using IPFS. Then, the data will be scaled and filtered using noise-invariant data expansion. Next, an adaptive random forest algorithm is made in order to train data on the training dataset, and people with diabetes were classified using the proposed model. Three datasets were used, namely, the Pima Indian diabetes dataset, the Frankfurt Hospital diabetes dataset, and the last is the fusion of these two datasets. Finally, the performance of the method was evaluated and compared with other recent prediction methods. Based on the experiment result, an accuracy of 85.9%, 99.5%, and 99.8% has been achieved based on the three datasets, respectively. Thus, the model can be used to predict and alert physicians or hospitals serious cases that need urgent reactions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Diabetes disease; Internet of things (IoT); Machine learning; Medical treatment","非CCF推荐");

In such permissioned blockchain, the transaction (TX) assignment strategy could be malicious such that the network shards may possibly receive imbalanced transactions or even bursty-TX injection attacks. An imbalanced transaction assignment brings serious threats to the stability of the sharded blockchain. A stable sharded blockchain can ensure that each shard processes the arrived transactions timely. Since the system stability is closely related to the blockchain throughput, how to maintain a stable sharded blockchain becomes a challenge. To depict the transaction processing in each network shard, we adopt the Lyapunov Optimization framework. Exploiting drift-plus-penalty (DPP) technique, we then propose an adaptive resource-allocation algorithm, which can yield the near-optimal solution for each network shard while the shard queues can also be stably maintained. We also rigorously analyze the theoretical boundaries of both the system objective and the queue length of shards. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better balance between resource consumption and queue stability than other baselines. We particularly evaluate two representative cases of bursty-TX injection attacks, i.e., the continued attacks against all network shards and the drastic attacks against a single network shard.

The benefit of investigating diversity are multi-fold, including understanding the Ethereum ecosystem deeper and opening the possibility of tracking certain abnormal activities. Unfortunately, the exploration of blockchain account diversity remains scarce. Even the most relevant studies, which focus on the deanonymization of the accounts on Bitcoin, can hardly be applied on Ethereum since their underlying protocols and user idioms are different. To this end, we present the first attempt to demystify the account diversity on Ethereum. The key observation is that different accounts exhibit diverse behavior patterns, leading us to propose the heuristics for classification as the premise.

We collect real-world data through extensive efforts to evaluate our proposed method and show its effectiveness. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analysis of the dynamic evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem and uncover the abnormal arbitrage actions.

The present day predictions for the influence of IoT are highly monumental. This is because data of any form is found to be predominant to the IoT paradigm, therefore serving different applications like smart home, smart city, healthcare, smart grid, smart farms, manufacturing, and so on. Hence, several heterogeneous sensors are said in existence to estimate different types of parameters and found to be useful for different users. In this paper, a secured image sharing method called a Blockchain Chaotic and Paillier Map-based Authentication (BC-PMA) to provide image data integrity and security by deploying a cloud computing environment is proposed. The BC-PMA method is split into three sections. First, registration of corresponding classes of images in the cloud server via blockchain is presented by employing the Cat Map Registration model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing Paillier Map-based Authentication where validation is ensured via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, unique and separate classes of images are provided with the respective, therefore ensuring secured classes of image sharing between users in the cloud environment. The results have been analyzed against traditional blockchain-based methods and validated with enhanced simulated results, that good authentication accuracy, minimizing the false positive rate, block generation time, and size considerably.

Moreover, identifying and evaluating the blockchain technology application criteria in the logistics system is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) challenge that requires taking into account the perspectives of experts with varying degrees of SC expertise. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel group decision-making method based on the best-worst method (BWM) to evaluate the criteria of implementing blockchain technology in the SC. The proposed approach provides a mechanism whereby opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are aggregated in nine steps, first. Then, weights of criteria are determined using BWM individual decision-making models. Moreover, two individual decision-making methods called nonlinear goal programming based BWM II (NGPBWM II) and linear goal programming based BWM II (LGPBWM II) are extended in this study, which can be adopted in both individual and group decision-making problems. The NGPBWM II and LGPBWM II methods can be used for both individual and group decision-making. This study proposes a novel group decision-making framework. The framework has fewer constraints than previous group BWM models and can consider different best (worst) criteria by different DMs. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated employing eight numerical examples. The results reveal the high accuracy of the NGPBWM II in all eight examples.

Fast and efficient keywords search in medical cloud is the key first step to achieve it. However, untrusted servicer may return the false search results or the results related to some special commercial purpose. Additionally, privacy leakage in medical data will also damage the benefits of the users and primary data owners. Ensuring fair and accurate searching of shared data and protecting the privacy of medical data have become important in the medical sharing system. This paper aims at solving these problems and a search framework for smart health system is proposed. In the framework, two smart contracts, named search smart contract(SSC) and verify smart contract(VSC), are constructed based on Ethereum blockchain, which are used to match the user's trapdoor with index and check the correctness of search results. To improve the search accuracy, we realizes a ranking multi-keyword search where it only returns the top-k documents which best meet the user's needs. Additionally, a new attribute-based encryption(ABE) is introduced to keep confidentiality and access authority of the sharing data.

Threat intelligence sharing is an effective way to resist cyber security threats. However, there is a contradiction between information integrity and the requirement of building a complete attack chain in the threat intelligence sharing and utilization. Due to the limited capacity of block storage pattern, it can be found that threat intelligence is prone to fragmentation on blockchain. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled Threat Intelligence Integrity Audit (TIIA) scheme for IIoT is proposed. This scheme can audit the integrity of threat intelligence in ciphertext state to ensure the confidentiality protection requirements of threat intelligence on blockchain. A double chain structure is presented in the TIIA scheme. The storage-chain is used to store threat intelligence ciphertext, while the audit-chain is designed to achieve the integrity audit of the corresponding fragment on the storage-chain. In addition, Paillier homomorphic encryption and searchable encryption are used to realize the confidentiality and ciphertext retrieval of threat intelligence on the storage-chain.

A user on the Ethereum platform can implement smart contracts as well as remit its cryptocurrency. Cyber-attacks often target cryptocurrency. Besides, Ethereum may be exploited by malicious users for launching attacks. Therefore, the demand for Ethereum network supervision is increasing. To protect interior users on Ethereum from attacks, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) should supervise the Ethereum traffic from or to its internal users. Ethereum traffic identification is the first step towards supervision. Ethereum is a peer-to-peer communication network implemented by DEVp2p. DEVp2p is designed to realize data interaction and adopts encryption to enhance anonymity on Ethereum. It is difficult to identify Ethereum traffic accurately at line speed in a high-speed network. So far, Ethereum traffic identification has not been explored yet. This paper designs an efficient Ethereum traffic identification system with high identification accuracy, dubbed ETI (Ethereum Traffic Identification), for an ISP to supervise its internal users on Ethereum without Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). ETI first constructs an active node library consisting of core nodes on Ethereum and active Ethereum peers in the ISP. Then potential Ethereum flows are filtered by checking if their sources or destinations are in the active node library. As active Ethereum nodes may generate non-Ethereum traffic, machine learning classifiers are further adopted to judge if the potential Ethereum traffic is actually from Ethereum. The classification is based on the unique packet/payload-length and port number-related traffic features on Ethereum implemented by DEVp2p. Our experimental studies validate that ETI outperforms state-of-the-art network traffic classification methods in identification accuracy and time efficiency.

However, traditional and contracts have many challenges. This has created the need for automated digital contracts, which are largely used within organizations. Although these contracts provide their own sets of advantages, they still have a single point of failure and still rely on trusted parties that cannot enforce rules. This has caused the introduction of blockchain smart contracts to help organizations collaborate in a decentralized manner. However, most contracting approaches are still influenced by traditional contracting schemes and cannot leverage the blockchain's features. This has made contracts designed over the blockchain network inefficient and difficult to manage. Existing contractual approaches also do not account for the full advantages of blockchain smart contracts due to a lack of focus in this area. The blockchain and its contracting mechanism are unique, and thus, a unique perspective must be brought in designing a contracting scheme that works efficiently with the blockchain and its inherent smart contracts. In this work, we develop a unique contractual approach that is adaptive to the blockchain and leverages its features in ensuring an efficient contracting scheme that is able to solve the major operations within organizations. We introduce a novel concept of contracting among blockchain networks using existing contract theory concepts to understand better how participants can work together across multiple organizations. We create a novel multi-contracting scheme for multiple parties to collaborate and work together efficiently between multiple organizations, ensuring the completion of projects and contract solidification. We develop a complex interlinked system of contracts to make contacts among multiple organizations easily traceable and manageable.

However, when using blockchain technology, the proof-of-work completed by vehicles may consume substantial energy and computing resources, which limits the application of blockchain technology in the internet of vehicles environment. Therefore, this paper considers deploying edge computing nodes to support blockchain technology and introducing an auction mechanism to encourage users to record vehicle driving data as miners. This paper proposes two auction mechanisms for the blockchain network formed by edge computing service providers and miners to maximize the social welfare. Specifically, one mechanism is used when the resource demands of the miners are the same, and the other is used when the resource demands of the miners are different. For resource allocation, the former uses the maximum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve optimal allocation, and the latter uses a heuristic algorithm. For price payment, the former uses the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism, and the latter uses dichotomy. These two price payment algorithms use critical value theory to calculate the payment price. This paper demonstrates that both are truthful and individually rational. Through experiments, this paper evaluates indicators such as social welfare, satisfaction, and resource utilization. The experiments show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively maximize social welfare in the blockchain network and provide an effective resource allocation strategy for edge computing service providers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Edge computing; Internet of vehicles; Mechanism design; Resource allocationBlockchain; Computation theory; Heuristic algorithms; Machine design; Miners; Resource allocation; Vehicles; Auctions mechanisms; Block-chain; Computing services; Edge computing; Internet of vehicle; Mechanism design; Resource demands; Resources allocation; Service provider; Social welfare; Edge computing","C");

In this article, we present Pistis, a framework for issuing authorized and trusted certificates with the distributed ledger and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. In Pistis, TEE nodes validate whether the domain in a requested certificate passes the domain ownership validation (i.e., under corresponding applicants' control) and submit attested results to a smart contract in the distributed ledger. The smart contract issues a certificate to the applicant when an attested result shows a pass. Therefore, Pistis can ensure its issued certificates are authorized due to the domain ownership validation mechanism in the TEE. Furthermore, as the issued certificates are stored in a Merkle Patricia Tree (MPT) in Pistis, they are trusted and can be verified by a normal user easily. The security of Pistis is formally proved in the Universally Composable (UC) framework.

However, blockchain is a highly resource demanding technology. The ambition of this paper is to propose a new approach for defining lightweight smart contracts, offering a high level of trust even without blockchain, when the underlying operating system can be trusted. Blockchain can be used for a higher degree of trust, for instance when the runtime system cannot be trusted. The approach gives transparency and immutability, and gives protection against corrupted or incorrect smart contract implementations. This is achieved by letting smart contract requirement specifications be separated from the smart contract implementations, provided by special objects, so-called history objects, recording all transactions of the associated contract. The history objects are generated by the runtime system as specially protected objects. Contract partners may interact with the history objects through predefined interfaces. We present a framework which includes an executable, imperative language for writing smart contracts, a functional language for contract specifications by means of invariants over the transaction history of a contract, as well as a verification system. The framework allows compositional and class-wise verification.

Data stored in each of the healthcare institution remain in silos which cannot be easily shared with other institutions due to technical and infrastructural constraints. Hospitals do not have an effective and secure data sharing mechanism leading to monetary and resource loss in the case of a person visiting different hospitals. Blockchain, a disruptive technology with secure and reliable decentralized framework, and can be used to circumvent problems in traditional healthcare architecture for secure storage, sharing and retrieval of Electronic Health Records (EHR). A blockchain-based framework integrated with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for EHR in healthcare management has been proposed in this paper. This proposed framework will enable healthcare institutions to maintain fail-safe and tamper-proof healthcare ledgers in a decentralized manner. Hospitals and doctors act as lightweight nodes, whereas patient nodes can be full or lightweight nodes. The model proposes two-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication for preventing fake node attacks. Patient-centric access model allows the patients to act as digital stewards for their health data, allowing access to doctors and hospitals on demand and revoking it after stipulated time. Symmetric key encryption (AES-128) is used for encrypting data before storing into IPFS. Asymmetric encryption (RSA-4096) is used for generating digital envelopes to pass on symmetric key to authorized entities. Digital signatures (RSA-1024) make sure that the transactions are valid and from authorized nodes. Hashing of the encrypted data is done using SHA-256 algorithm. Multiple layers of security implemented in this model makes sure that adversaries cannot obtain data stored in IPFS; even if they retrieve the data, it will not be meaningful since it is encrypted.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SG-PBFT (Score Grouping-PBFT), a secure and efficient distributed consensus algorithm for blockchain applications in the IoV. The distributed structure can reduce the pressure on the central server and decrease the risk of single-node attacks. The SG-PBFT consensus algorithm improves the traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm by optimizing the PBFT consensus process and using a score grouping mechanism to achieve a higher consensus efficiency. The experimental results show that the method can greatly improve the consistency efficiency and effectively prevent single-node attacks. Specifically, when the number of consensus nodes reaches 1000, the consensus time of our algorithm is only about 27% of what is required for the state-of-the-art PBFT consensus algorithm.

However, the existing solutions suffer from three main limitations: 1) inability to concurrently achieve task privacy protection and distributed transparent storage, 2) limited transaction throughput caused by serial transaction processing, and 3) low fault-tolerance ability of their practical byzantine-fault-tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocols. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid-blockchain crowdsourcing platform named CHChain. The core of CHChain is a hybrid blockchain structure, which achieves distributed and transparent storage while guaranteeing task privacy by isolating the private information of each task (e.g., task response, evaluation, and feedback) into its own private task chain, and recording other common information of tasks (e.g., task ID, reward, and deadline) into a common chain. To improve transaction throughput, we then design a parallel-transaction-processing chaincode (PTPC), a chaincode running on the hybrid blockchain structure, to process transactions in parallel, which is also responsible for evaluating the reputations of platform users.

The majority of existing research works rely on a unique third-party auditor (TPA) or fixed TPAs to audit the integrity of outsourced data, and thus they are vulnerable to DoS and collusion attacks as the TPA is not completely trusted. To conquer this problem, a blockchain-based random auditor committee is proposed to replace the fixed TPAs for the integrity verification (call BRAC scheme for short). The proposed blockchain consensus algorithm utilizes a verifiable random function (VRF) to select the third-party auditor committee (TPAC) which performs contract verification. The leader of TPAs (LTPA) packs the verification proof into a blockchain called verification chain. The main idea is employing the output of a VRF for leader election to make it probabilistic, such that specific nodes cannot be targeted in advance and a certain fraction of the nodes being malicious can be tolerated. We present rigorous security analysis to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. Meanwhile, the comprehensive performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme improves the performance of data integrity verification effectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Cloud storage; Election algorithm; Integrity verification; Random auditor committeeDigital storage; Network security; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Collusion attack; Consensus algorithms; Election algorithms; Integrity verifications; Outsourced datum; Random auditor committee; Third parties; Verifiable random function; Blockchain","C");

One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum blockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test networks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as Bloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets. Since transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions are consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small amounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some small amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result, rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more general distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary amounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this end, Max–min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralised settings. Our work contributes a Max–min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart contract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the number of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart contract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users would mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making the smart contract ineffective.

With the increasing number of IoT users and devices, the demands for secure communication and data confidentiality are getting higher and higher, and the identity authentication and access control of IoT devices has become a huge challenge. In the IoT environment, the traditional device identity and access management methods based on public key infrastructure (PKI) and blockchain bring the problems of single point failure and scalability. The emergence of decentralized storage system and distributed ledger technology directed acyclic graph (DAG) provide new ideas to solve these problems. In the paper, we use distributed ledger technology IOTA with low energy demand to design a lightweight and scalable mechanism to manage the identity of IoT devices and access control of large-scale IoT data, so as to ensure source reliability and sharing security of IoT data. In the new scheme, IOTA technology is used to realize the functions of registration, update, revocation and retrieval of the identity of IoT devices, which solves the defects caused by centralized management. Inter planetary file system (IPFS) is used to store a large amount of data generated by devices in the IoT, which not only reduces the burden on devices and systems of IoT, but also solves the single point of failure, delay and other problems caused by traditional cloud storage. At the same time, the fog node is used to provide localized computing for a group of IoT devices to solve the problem of limited computing resources of IoT devices. In addition, in order to prevent data abuse caused by unauthorized devices accessing network resources, a trusted access control mechanism is designed to achieve fine-grained access control, access policy update and other functions, so as to better maintain the IoT environment and network security.

The sharing of electronic health records not only helps people use medical resources anytime and anywhere to deal with tricky physical conditions but also provides valuable and true reference materials for medical practitioners in related research. However, the current electronic health record sharing schemes have the problems of electronic health record data leakage, access authorization mechanism incomplete, inflexible operation of electronic health record data, low search efficiency, and untrustworthy cloud server provider. To solve these challenging problems, we propose a new blockchain-based keyword search scheme with dual authorization for electronic health record sharing. The certificateless cryptosystem avoids certificate management and key escrow. The construction of the authorization matrix realizes the dual authorization of the identities of users and the corresponding searchable departments. Also, the matrix can manage the access rights of users. The signal value of the ciphertext index can realize the authority management of ciphertext index. The ciphertext MAC verification code stored in the blockchain can verify the legality of ciphertext, and the smart contract is used to ensure fair transactions. Therefore, our scheme is more suitable for sharing confidential and sensitive electronic health records. The security proof concludes that the proposed scheme is indistinguishability under the keyword guessing attack.

Traditionally, there has been a lot of manual processes related to payment. Nowadays the technology advancements make the payment process in electronic form. Even the electronic form is not easily accessible to all parties in the supply chain. Each entity of the supply chain maintains separate transaction records that remain difficult, inefficient, and error prone. Often companies face difficulties in monitoring the status of shipments and linking them to payments. In the real world, the suppliers offer buyers three terms of payment of purchase costs. The buyer pays the supplier as advance payment, cash, or credit. This research considers that the supplier ships the goods to the buyer by means of third-party logistics services. The supplier initially pays an advance to the external logistics provider while shipping the product to the buyer. Once the buyer verify that the goods are received in correct quantity, the supplier shall pay the balance amount to the third-party logistics provider. This research proposes a blockchain-based smart contract for supply chain transactions. This paper presents a general platform for stakeholders in the supply chain through an Ethereum based smart contract with comprehensive interaction algorithm that enables decentralized authorization, process automation, and information sharing between the supply chain stakeholders. The proposed smart contract benefits the supplier by lowering the risk of non-payment during the credit period. In addition, the buyer benefits from on-time delivery performance and product tracking.

In this paper, we propose FGFL, a blockchain-based incentive governor for Federated Learning. In FGFL, we assess the participants with reputation and contribution indicators. Then the task publisher rewards workers fairly to attract efficient ones while the malicious ones are punished and eliminated. In addition, we propose a blockchain-based incentive management system to manage the incentive mechanism. We evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of FGFL through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The evaluation results show that FGFL fairly rewards workers according to their corresponding behavior and quality. FGFL increases the system revenue by 0.2% to 3.4% in reliable federations compared with baselines. And in the unreliable scenario where contains attackers, the system revenue of FGFL outperforms the baselines by more than 46.7%. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Attack detection; Federated Learning; Incentive mechanismData privacy; Governors; Quality control; Attack detection; Block-chain; Computing resource; Federated learning; Incentive mechanism; Large amounts; Shared model; Training data; Training needs; Workers'; Blockchain","B");

Due to the independence between blockchains, it is tough to complete asset exchange tasks between diverse chains. Facing this problem, multiple cross-chain exchange schemes were proposed, but they have not been widely used due to various defects in terms of compatibility, flexibility, security, and practicability. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive cross-chain exchange system called Practical AgentChain. Various coins can be mapped to the corresponding tokens on Practical AgentChain for trading. One or multiple trading operators can spontaneously form a service deposit pool on existing blockchains and register a trading group for profit using the well-designed smart contract called Agent Contract. All the trading groups competitively provide cross-chain exchange services. Clients with exchange currency requirements can freely select an appropriate trading group to request services, such as mapping assets to tokens or withdraw tokens. The choice of the trading group is made according to the group's deposit and the group members’ reputation recorded on the Agent Contract. This system also incorporates Town crier as the reliable Data Oracle system for obtaining the status of cross-chain transactions and combines a matching exchange protocol to ensure the fairness of on-chain token exchange. In addition, we design an impartial service arbitration mechanism and a deposit allocation scheme to ensure the reliability of the system. Through security analysis, our system can resist re-use attacks, denial-of-service attacks and resolve service availability issues. We modify the Town crier adaptively and combine it with Ethereum to implement the simulation. The experimental results show that Practical AgentChain is efficient and low-cost.

The majority of network nodes need to be enforced to use one or both of the following approaches to remain consistent: (i) to wait for certain delays (i.e. by requesting a hard puzzle solution as in PoW and PoUW, or to wait for random delays as in PoET, etc.) (ii) to propagate shared data through shortest possible paths within the network. The first approach may cause higher energy consumption and/or lower throughput rates if not optimized, and in many cases these features are conventionally fixed. Therefore, it is preferred to enhance the second approach with some optimization. Previous works for this approach have the following drawbacks: they may violate the identity privacy of miners, only locally optimize the Neighbor Selection method (NS), do not consider the dynamicity of the network, or require the nodes to know the precise size of the network at all times. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a Dynamic and Optimized NS protocol called DONS, using a novel privacy-aware leader election within the public BC called AnoLE, where the leader anonymously solves the The Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) of the network in polynomial time. Consequently, miners are informed about the optimum NS according to the current state of network topology. We analytically evaluate the complexity, the security and the privacy of the proposed protocols against state-of-the-art MST solutions for DLs and well known attacks. Additionally, we experimentally show that the proposed protocols outperform state-of-the-art NS solutions for public BCs. Our evaluation shows that the proposed DONS and AnoLE protocols are secure, private, and they acutely outperform all current NS solutions in terms of block finality and fidelity. © 2021 The Author(s)","Anonymized Leader Election; Blockchain; Minimum Spanning Tree; Optimized neighbor selection; Smart networkingDistributed ledger; Energy utilization; Miners; Polynomial approximation; 'current; Anonymized leader election; Block-chain; Leader election; Minimum Spanning Tree problem; Minimums panning tree; Neighbour selections; Optimized neighbor selection; Selection methods; Smart networking; Blockchain","C");

In the process of computation offloading in edge computing, it is critical to dynamically make optimal offloading decisions to minimize the delay and energy consumption spent on the devices.

The advantages of this technology have raised the importance of Industrial Internet-of-Thing (IIoT) and have paved the pathway for 'Industry 4.0.' Surprisingly, access control has received less attention in IIoTs. Though there are some solutions coming forward to use blockchains for IIoT to enable secure and resilient access control management, the challenge is to satisfy the low-latency requirements of IIoTs for validating and adding the blocks to the chain. Besides, role-based and rule-based access controls in the existing systems can be forged without organizational access controls and compliance. Therefore, we address these problems in this article. In the present work, we propose DHACS, a Decentralized Hybrid Access Control for Smart contract, for IIoTs. DHACS aims to provide transparency, reliability, and robustness to the existing access control mechanism in IIoTs. The framework is based on blockchain feasibilities that contribute to an interconnected hybrid access control through smart contract provision. It is a novel idea in the domain of IIoTs. We use three access control strategies, role-based, rule-based, and organization-based, to develop a hybrid approach for smart contract in DHACS. The operational transactions along with their access controls are accounted and blocks are made by the transaction pooler and block creator. We use a private blockchain environment; however, it can be extended to a public blockchain or consortium blockchain for geographical distributed dependency. We compare DHACS with three existing approaches in recent time. We measure the performance in terms of computational costs, storage complexity, and energy consumption. DHACS outperforms the others approaches and is considered to be efficient for IIoT applications with more than 30% better efficiency in access control management. To the best of our knowledge, DHACS is the first attempt to use decentralized blockchains with smart contract for hybrid access control in IIoTs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Access control; blockchain; industrial; IoT; securityBlockchain; Energy utilization; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Access control managements; Access control mechanism; Computational costs; Contract provisions; Control strategies; Hybrid approach; Reliability and robustness; Storage complexity; Access control","非CCF推荐");

The small cell-based network architecture and device-to-device (D2D) communication are already being considered part of 5G networks and beyond. In such environments, network coding (NC) can be employed to achieve both higher throughput and energy efficiency. However, NC-enabled systems need to address security challenges specific to NC, such as pollution attacks. All integrity schemes against pollution attacks generally require proper key distribution and management to ensure security in a mobile environment. Additionally, the mobility requirements in small cell environments are more challenging and demanding in terms of signaling overhead. This paper proposes a blockchain-assisted key distribution protocol tailored for MAC-based integrity schemes, which combined with an uplink reference signal (UL RS) handover mechanism, enables energy efficient secure NC. The performance analysis of the protocol during handover scenarios indicates its suitability for ensuring high level of security against pollution attacks in dense small cell environments with multiple adversaries being present. Furthermore, the proposed scheme achieves lower bandwidth and signaling overhead during handover compared to legacy schemes and the signaling cost reduces significantly as the communication progresses, thus enhancing the network's cumulative energy efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","5G and Small cells; Handover; Key management; Network CodingCell signaling; Cells; Cytology; Energy efficiency; Mobile security; Network architecture; Network coding; Network security; Pollution; Wireless networks; 5g and small cell; Energy efficient; Hand over; Integrated approach; Key-distribution protocols; Key-management; Pollution attack; Secure Network Coding; Signaling overheads; Small cells; 5G mobile communication systems","B");

In the space segment, satellite constellations can cooperate to provide better space services. However, due to the lack of trust among different constellations, communication security and privacy protection are important issues that need to be solved during inter-constellation cooperation. In this work, with recent advances of blockchain, we present a trusted and privacy-preserved authentication scheme for inter-constellation collaboration. To preserve privacy, we design permanent and temporary identities for each satellite. The permanent one is used for inner-constellation communication, and the temporary identity is for inter-constellation cooperation, respectively. Meanwhile, satellites generate temporary identities for themselves to avoid privacy leakage. A consortium blockchain is introduced for sharing information among cooperative satellite constellations. Furthermore, to achieve efficient authentication under limited resources, a replica storage node method is proposed, where well-resourced satellites cache the replicated information shared through the blockchain. The replica storage node selection is formulated as an integer programming problem and solved with a branch and bound algorithm. Security analysis, including formal analysis using BAN Logic and informal verification, shows that the proposed authentication scheme is secure against various potential attacks. A comparative analysis among the proposed scheme and other blockchain-based schemes shows that the proposed scheme achieves efficiency in signaling, computation, and communication overheads with more functionality attributes. In addition, evaluations also demonstrate that the proposed on-board caching scheme achieves low communication latency and storage cost. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Inter-constellation satellite authentication; Replica storage node selectionBlockchain; Branch and bound method; Computation theory; Integer programming; Satellites; Access service; Authentication scheme; Block-chain; Constellation satellites; Integrated networks; Inter-constellation satellite authentication; Node selection; Replica storage node selection; Satellite constellations; Storage nodes; Authentication","B");

Despite its strong protection for security and privacy, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only support a low number of transactions per second (TPS). Besides the PoW consensus protocol, the other key aspect of Bitcoin that limits TPS is its networking protocol. In this work, we aim at redesigning the current Bitcoin's networking protocol to increase TPS without changing the vital components in its consensus-building protocol. In particular, this work improves the compact-block relaying protocol to enable the propagation of blocks containing a massive number of transactions without inducing extra propagation latencies. The improvements of this work consist of (i) replacing the existing store-and-forward compact-block relaying scheme with a cut-through compact-block relaying scheme; (ii) exploiting rateless erasure codes for P2P networks to increase the block-propagation efficiency. Since the protocols designed in this work only need to rework the current Bitcoin's networking protocol and do not modify the data structures and crypto-functional components, they can be seamlessly incorporated into the existing Bitcoin blockchain. To validate the designs, we perform analysis on the protocols and implement a Bitcoin network simulator on NS3 to run different block propagation protocols. Our analysis and experimental results confirm that the new block propagation protocols could increase the TPS of the Bitcoin blockchain by 100x without compromising security and consensus-building. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Cut-through forwarding; Networking protocol; Rateless codingBitcoin; Internet protocols; Network coding; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Relay control systems; 'current; Block propagation; Block-chain; Consensus buildings; Cut-through; Cut-through forwarding; Networking protocols; Rateless coding; Relaying schemes; UNCODED; Blockchain","B");

One of the main properties of the SDN architecture is the ability to offer a northbound interface (NBI), which enables network applications to access the SDN controller resources. However, the NBI can be compromised by a malicious application due to the lack of standardization and security aspects in the most current NBI designs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive security solution for securing the application–controller interface, named BCNBI. We propose a controller-independent lightweight blockchain architecture and exploit the security features of blockchain while limiting the blockchain’s computational overhead. BCNBI automatically verifies application and SDN controller credentials through token-based authentication. The proposed solution enforces fine-grained access control for each application’s API request and classifies the permission set into strict and normal policies, in order to add an extra level of security. In addition, the trustworthiness of applications is evaluated in order to prevent malicious activities. We implemented our blockchain-based solution to analyze its security, based on the confidentiality– integrity–availability model criteria, and evaluated the introduced overhead in terms of processing time and packet overhead. The experimental results demonstrate that the BCNBI can effectively secure the NBI, based on the fundamental security goals, while introducing insignificant overhead. © 2022 by the authors.

A PDF document, the most popular document format, provides an identical document layout regardless of OS or device and has a content integrity verification feature with a digital signature. However, it has a bad user experience, such as low readability on a mobile device. On the other hand, an HTML document has a weakness in verifying the content integrity even though it is the primary document format and provides a good user experience on mobile devices. There are certified document services using blockchain technology, but it is still vulnerable to verifying content integrity. Furthermore, research on the document HTML has proposed the trusted document generation technique by HTML conformance and digital signature; however, this research does not provide content delivery verification, and there is a file size overhead. In this paper, we have developed the chained document HTML by defining HTML conformance, digital signature, and blockchain technology. First, the chained document HTML has to embed all resources and does not allow loading content on-demand. Second, the file is signed by a digital signature, and the signature value is added in the file header. Lastly, the metadata to verify the content integrity is inserted in a blockchain node. We have created the chained document HTML generation and verification experiment environment by Ethereum and Python. We have confirmed that the chained document HTML provides content and delivery integrity verification in the research. We expect the chained document HTML will be widely used in document communication between an enterprise and a customer, especially if the document has sensitive personal information that might have a legal dispute. © 2022 by the authors.

In this context, blockchain technology has been foreseen by the industry and research community as a disruptive technology that can be integrated into novel security solutions for IoMT edge networks, as it can play a significant role in securing IoMT devices and resisting unauthorized access during data transmission (i.e., tamper-proof transmission of medical data). However, despite the fact that several blockchain-based security mechanisms have already been proposed in the literature for different types of IoT edge networks, there is a lack of blockchain-based security mechanisms for IoMT edge networks, and thus more effort is required to be put on the design and development of security mechanisms relying on blockchain technology for such networks. Towards this direction, the first step is the comprehensive understanding of the following two types of blockchain-based security mechanisms: (a) the very few existing ones specifically designed for IoMT edge networks, and (b) those designed for other types of IoT networks but could be possibly adopted in IoMT edge networks due to similar capabilities and technical characteristics. Therefore, in this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of the above two types of blockchain-based security mechanisms in order to provide a foundation for organizing research efforts towards the design and development of reliable blockchain-based countermeasures, addressing the pressing security challenges of IoMT edge networks in an effective and efficient manner. © 2022 by the authors.

However, despite the advantages, there are various risks associated with these vehicles. These vehicles interact with each other by forming a vehicular network, also known as VANET, in a centralized manner. This centralized network is vulnerable to cyber-attacks which can cause data loss, resulting in road accidents. Thus, to prevent the vehicular network from being attacked and to prevent the privacy of the data, key management is used. However, key management alone over a centralized network is not effective in ensuring data integrity in a vehicular network. To resolve this issue, various studies have introduced a blockchain-based approach and enabled key management over a decentralized network. This technique is also found effective in ensuring the privacy of all the stakeholders involved in a vehicular network. Furthermore, a blockchain-based key management system can also help in storing a large amount of data over a distributed network, which can encourage a faster exchange of information between vehicles in a network. However, there are certain limitations of blockchain technology that may affect the efficient working of autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing blockchain-based systems are implemented over Ethereum or Bitcoin. The transaction-processing capability of these blockchains is in the range of 5 to 20 transactions per second, whereas hashgraphs are capable of processing thousands of transactions per second as the data are processed exponentially. Furthermore, a hashgraph prevents the user from altering the order of the transactions being processed, and they do not need high computational powers to operate, which may help in reducing the overall cost of the system. Due to the advantages offered by a hashgraph, an advanced key management framework based on a hashgraph for secure communication between the vehicles is suggested in this paper. The framework is developed using the concept of Leaving of Vehicles based on a Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) and Batch Rekeying. The system is tested and compared with other closely related systems on the basis of the transaction compilation time and change in traffic rates. © 2022 by the authors.

Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-To-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources.

Data is commonly stored on cloud servers in the form of ciphertext to protect security and concealment of data. When a consumer requests to access of encrypted data, a third party must provide an access key. The system's security, however, will be compromised if the third party or internal personnel are dishonest. To address this issue, a novel blockchain-based secure decentralized system using IPFS is proposed in this research for secure data transfer. Because all participant of system model are recorded the every action on the chain, and the continuously extending chain makes it conditionally difficult to modify any block without being detected, a blockchain based system is often regarded as a safe platform. In the proposed approach, the data owner uploads an encrypted file to IPFS, which is subsequently separated into n secret sections called hash codes for data security. The data owner must additionally write the access permissions in order to achieve access to this secure data. For security, the system uses two-level key management: first, the data owner encrypts the file, and then the IPFS server makes a hash code of that encrypted file. The proposed solution, which employs blockchain technology, enables consumers to be handled across several domains, erase the single-point failure in traditional centralized systems, and overhead related to communication and computation are decreased at the consumer level. According to the security analysis, the proposed system might effectively resist single and collaboratively malicious persons, as well as untrustworthy cloud servers. © 2022 The Author(s)","Blockchain; Centralized; Cloud storage; Data sharing; Decentralized; Interplanetary File System (IPFS); Multi-authority; Semi-decentralized","非CCF推荐");

In this study, one of those public-key algorithms, known as Merkle–Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem (MHKC), is employed to cryptographically analyze its utilization for blockchain technology using a metaheuristic algorithm. To do so, eight well-known metaheuristic algorithms are employed to determine the trustworthiness of MHKC against cryptoanalysis attacks using various knapsack lengths, ranging from 8 to 32 bits. The experimental findings showed that pathfinder algorithm (PFA) and slime mold optimizer (SMA) could exploit MHKC under 8-bit ASCII code, and their performance gradually deteriorates with higher bit representations, while the performance of manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) could be superior for the knapsack lengths higher than 8-bit.

Because of the lack of an existing foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed.

The Lightning Network (LN) is the biggest PCN to date. As of September 2021, LN is an interconnected network with 27 thousand nodes and 71 thousand channels, representing a total payment capacity of 2500 bitcoins (114M USD). LN nodes establish trustless payment channels by locking funds in a funding transaction. The distribution of the funds can be modified with near-instant transactions without broadcasting them to the blockchain. By chaining channels together, it is possible for two nodes to transact without having a direct channel between them. This results in far fewer transactions needing to be broadcast and a theoretical number of off-chain transactions per second that can rival established, centralized payment systems. With off-chain transactions one can obtain more privacy than with on-chain transaction: individual payments through LN should be able to stay private. However, recent research suggests that this is not the case. Several works have shown that channel balances can be tracked with the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA). Monitoring the changes in channel balances over time enables an adversary to track individual payments in LN. Since payments can travel through channels outside the scope of influence of the payer or the payee, these BDA's form an Interdependent Privacy (IDP) risk for the participants of the LN network. This work applies approximate differential privacy to hide payment amounts of a realistic size in LN. To our knowledge, this is the first time that strong privacy guarantees in the sense of approximate differential privacy are achieved in the setting of LN. We prove the feasibility with our prototype, compatible with LN today. Our solution is evaluated in terms of cost and utility and we show that the latter is not affected by our solution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Balance discovery attack; Bitcoin; Channel probing; Differential privacy; Lightning network; Network privacy and anonymityBitcoin; Blockchain; Balance discovery attack; Block-chain; Channel balance; Channel network; Channel probing; Differential privacies; Lightning network; Network forms; Network privacy; Network privacy and anonymity; Lightning","非CCF推荐");

This research proposes two different types of blockchains namely mainchain and sidechain. Metadata is stored in the mainchain that is publicly accessible, and non-transactional data, such as pictures, contracts, PDF, other allied information, is stored in the sidechain. It mainly focuses on using blockchain in the land registry data storage, improving information management, reducing authentication time, decreasing storage consumption that leads to optimized searching of land records in the blockchain. The proposed framework uses a summary file and InterPlanetary File System based on a Peer-to-Peer swarm-based network. The summary file concept is used for searching documents in the sidechain, which can be queried using attributes of the registry and can be accessed by only authorized parties or persons involved in that transaction. The comparative assessment establishes that the proposed approach is more efficient than the existing leading approaches. The land record search time of the proposed algorithm is on an average lesser by 60% as compared with the linear search approach and by 25% when compared with the hash table-based search algorithm.

Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, we present our second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. Methods: We follow a feature-oriented approach to analyze three different blockchain platforms and propose an enhanced reference model and a modeling framework for smart contracts (iContractML 2.0). Then, we evaluate the coverage and extensibility of iContractML 2.0, first through mapping the concepts of the reference models to the constructs within each of the platforms used in devising the reference model, and second through mapping its concepts to a new smart contract language not previously considered. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of iContractML 2.0 using five case studies from different business domains. Results: iContractML 2.0 extends our first generation language to support DAML, which is another standardized language for smart contracts. This makes iContractML 2.0 supports the platforms that DAML support by extension. Moreover, iContractML 2.0 supports generating the structural and deployment artifacts in addition to the smart contract behavior by implementing templates for some of the common functions. The results of evaluating the generality of the iContractML 2.0 reference model show that it is 91.7% lucid and 72.2% laconic. Moreover, the reference model is able to capture all the elements of the new language with 83.3% of the components which have a direct one-to-one mapping.

The novelty of the work lies in proposing a scheme, to produce a peer-to-peer network, where each participant can directly interact with the information stored in the secure distributed ledger. Therefore, in this proposed scheme, the unnecessary forward of requisite data by a participant is reduced. Hence, not only minimization of communicational overhead is achieved, but also it minimizes the computational time of the whole scheme. The blockchain technology-based implementation is carried out on hyperledger composer along with hyperledger fabric. The security analysis of the proposed scheme has been done using Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic to ensure mutual authentication between the participants. Moreover, the proposed model, AUGChain, outperforms the other existing schemes by resisting different network security attacks like compromised server attacks, DOS, DDOS attacks, reducing communicational costs as well as computational time a significant amount. This has been done by reducing the execution time of the order of 7.5 ms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic; Hyperledger fabric; Network security attacks; User authentication schemeAuthentication; Blockchain; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Data privacy; Denial-of-service attack; Peer to peer networks; Block-chain; Computational time; Global mobility network; Hyperledg fabric; Mobile users; Network security attack; Networks security; Security and privacy; Security attacks; User authentication scheme; Network security","非CCF推荐");

IoV has emerged as the concrete practice of intelligent transportation. However, IoV is vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers because they use traditional RSA and elliptic cure cryptographic systems. Therefore, it is critical to improving the security of IoV against quantum computer attacks.

Considering the flexibility which is provided by the optimal switching in the smart grid, the reconfiguration problem is also considered in the model using some remote control switches. A stochastic framework based on the unscented transform is proposed to not only capture the independent randomness of the renewables but also to handle the correlated uncertainties among them.

However, due to the insufficient local computing and storage resources of IoT devices, logistics records with sensitive information are generally stored in a centralized cloud center, which could easily cause privacy leakage. In this study, we propose a blockchain-assisted secure storage scheme for logistics data. To be specific, this scheme can be briefly divided into two parts. The first part involves data generation and aggregation, session establishing, records encryption and storage, wherein a blockchain network is used to assist the cloud server with data storage, and smart contracts are deployed to provide reliable storage interfaces. In the second part, an efficient consensus mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of the consensus process. Also, the stored records can be securely audited by leveraging the deployed blockchain network.

Therefore, we introduce zkRep, a privacy-preserving scheme tailored for reputation-based blockchains. Our basic idea is to hide both the identity and reputation of the validators by periodically changing the identity and reputation commitments (i.e., aliases), which makes it much more difficult for slowly adaptive attackers to identify validators with high reputation value. To realize this idea, we utilize privacy-preserving Pedersen-commitment-based reputation updating and leader election schemes that operate on concealed reputations within an epoch. We also introduce a privacy-preserving identity update protocol that changes the identity and time-window-based cumulative reputation commitments during each epoch transition.

Blockchain technology provides a neutral third-party platform for healthcare applications on which trust can be built to increase confidence in all participating parties to create, store and share sensitive data.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for detecting the pool-hopping behavior in the Bitcoin network; we propose a deterministic framework exploiting the different time windowing phases (rounds, epochs) involved in the rewarding process. Our methodology includes a new algorithm to identify the miners, and a new algorithm to trace the revenue stream distribution.

The nodes in the network are authenticated based on their credentials to make the network free from malicious nodes. In IoST, sensor nodes gather the information from the environment and send it to the cluster heads (CHs) for additional processing. CHs aggregate the sensed information. Therefore, their energy rapidly depletes due to extra workload. To solve this issue, we proposed distance, degree, and residual energy-based low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (DDR-LEACH) protocol. DDR-LEACH is used to replace CHs with the ordinary nodes based on maximum residual energy, degree, and minimum distance from BS. Furthermore, storing a huge amount of data in the blockchain is very costly. To tackle this issue, an external data storage, named as interplanetary file system (IPFS), is used. Furthermore, for ensuring data security in IPFS, AES 128-bit is used, which performs better than the existing encryption schemes. Moreover, a huge computational cost is required using a proof of work consensus mechanism to validate transactions. To solve this issue, proof of authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used in the proposed model. The simulation results are carried out, which show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system model. The DDR-LEACH is compared with LEACH and the simulation results show that DDR-LEACH outperforms LEACH in terms of energy consumption, throughput, and improvement in network lifetime with CH selection mechanism. Moreover, transaction cost is computed, which is reduced by PoA during data storage on IPFS and service provisioning. Furthermore, the time is calculated in the comparison of AES 128-bit scheme with existing scheme. The formal security analysis is performed to check the effectiveness of smart contract against attacks. Additionally, two different attacks, MITM and Sybil, are induced in our system to show our system model's resilience against cyber attacks.","authentication; blockchain; clustering; interplanetary file system; LEACH protocol; malicious node detection; security; service provisioningcluster analysis; computer network; Internet; wireless communication; Blockchain; Cluster Analysis; Computer Communication Networks; Internet; Wireless Technology","非CCF推荐");

These trust metrics rely on the authenticity of the messages. Each vehicle assesses the authenticity of the received messages in real-time, calculates a local trust metric for the originator of such messages, then shares it with a miner.

The rapid evolution of digital technologies has often created the necessity for the establishment of an e-Governance model. There is often a need for an inclusive e-governance model with integrated multiactor governance services and where a single market approach can be adopted. e-Governance often aims to minimise bureaucratic processes, while at the same time including a digital-by-default approach to public services. This aims at administrative efficiency and the reduction of bureaucratic processes. It can also improve government capabilities, and enhances trust and security, which brings confidence in governmental transactions. However, solid implementations of a distributed data sharing model within an e-governance architecture is far from a reality; hence, citizens of European countries often go through the tedious process of having their confidential information verified. This paper focuses on the sinGLe sign-on e-GovernAnce Paradigm based on a distributed file-exchange network for security, transparency, cost-effectiveness and trust (GLASS) model, which aims to ensure that a citizen can control their relationship with governmental agencies. The paper thus proposes an approach that integrates a permissioned blockchain with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This method demonstrates how we may encrypt and store verifiable credentials of the GLASS ecosystem, such as academic awards, ID documents and so on, within IPFS in a secure manner and thus only allow trusted users to read a blockchain record, and obtain the encryption key. This allows for the decryption of a given verifiable credential that stored on IPFS.

Without a centralized broker, the proposed EggBlock platform can promote energy trading between users equipped with solar panels, and balance demand and generation. By applying the second price sealed-bid auction, which is one of the suitable pricing mechanisms in the blockchain technique, it is possible to derive truthful bidding of market participants according to their utility function and induce the proceed transaction. Furthermore, for efficient generation of solar energy, EggBlock proposes a Q-learning-based dynamic panel control mechanism. Specifically, we set the instantaneous direction of the solar panel and the amount of power generation as the state and reward, respectively. The angle of the panel to be moved becomes an action at the next time step. Then, we continuously update the Q-table using transfer learning, which can cope with recent changes in the surrounding environment or weather. We implement the proposed EggBlock platform using Ethereum’s smart contract for reliable transactions. At the end of the paper, measurement-based experiments show that the proposed EggBlock achieves reliable and transparent energy trading on the blockchain and converges to the optimal direction with short iterations.

We consider a Modified Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) to improve the security strength of the transmitted message. A secure hash function is used in conjunction with a key derivation function to modify the encryption procedure, which enhances the efficiency of the encryption and decryption by generating multiple secure keys through one master key. The proposed solution eliminates user-dependent variables by including transaction generation and verification in the calculation of computation time, resulting in increased system reliability.

However, these benefits will not materialise unless the technology is adopted by users. The combination of two factors, namely, the novelty of blockchain technology and the changing composition of the workforce, leads to the need to better understand the adoption of blockchain technology in an organisational setting. The purpose of this study was therefore to gain insights regarding the adoption of blockchain technology and use them to formulate practical recommendations for organisations. Using UTAUT2 as a conceptual framework, data was collected using an online questionnaire and analysed using structural equation modelling. Contrary to previous research, this study finds that intrinsic motivation, in the form of hedonic motivation, is a relevant factor in the organisational context and plays a role in the adoption of blockchain technology. Extrinsic motivation, in the form of performance expectancy, was also a significant predictor. Effort expectancy was not, suggesting that potential users of blockchain technology are not deterred by the complexity of the technology.

As a complement to cloud computing paradigm, fog computing has attracted great attention for which can effectively reduce task processing delay, energy and bandwidth consumptions. At the same time, fog computing based computation offloading mechanism has become a research focus, because it can effectively alleviate the processing burden of nodes and improve the experience of users. Under the fog computing paradigm, in order to better meet the requirements of delay and energy consumption for computation-intensive tasks, based on the blockchain- enabled Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, this paper proposes a resource allocation and control co-aware smart computation offloading scheme. Specifically, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total cost of all tasks under the constraints of delay, energy consumption, and communication and computation resources. Based on the comprehensive consideration, the component of the total cost includes the delay, energy consumption and resource mining costs; it can achieve the minimization of the total cost by jointly optimizing the communication resource, computation resource and offloading decision. In order to inspire the active participation of terminals and the fog node in the computation offloading process, and more close to the needs of the real scenario, an incentive mechanism is designed in this paper. That is, to complete the offloading of tasks, the terminal mines (rents) computation resource from the fog node as a miner and the fog node charges a certain fee according to the needed resource of terminal. For the terminals that successfully obtain the resources to complete the tasks efficiently, the system will allocate the corresponding rewards according to the occupation ratios of gained computation resource, which ensures the fairness allocation of the rewards for the successful miners. This mechanism enables that the fog node and terminals both can win benefits in the computation offloading process, which promotes their collaboration. Meanwhile, this blockchain-based incentive mechanism guarantees the security of the transaction process. For the sake of solving the above formulated optimization problem (i.e., a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem), we propose a communication, computation and control co-aware smart computation offloading algorithm (3CC-SCO). By integrating the concept of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, our algorithm designs an inverting gradient update based double actor-critic neural networks structure to improve the stable and convergence rate in the training process. At the same time, it is more suitable for solving the mixed integer optimization problem by adopting probabilistic discrete operation of continuous action output. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can converge to the optimal value quickly, and the total cost of the proposed scheme is the lowest compared with other three benchmark schemes, for example, as compared with the best- performing scheme, i.e., deep Q-learning network (DQN) based computation offloading scheme, the total cost can be reduced by an average of 15.2%. © 2022, Science Press.

As a result, the scalability problem of blockchain has been an increasing concern for researchers. The sharding mechanism is recognized as a promising approach to address this challenge. However, there are still many problems in the existing schemes. Firstly, realtime processing speed trades off security of validation. Secondly, simply randomly assigning nodes to the shards may make nodes located very far from each other, which increases the block propagation time and reduces the efficiency advantage brought by the sharding mechanism. Therefore, we optimize a reputation-based sharding consensus model by multi-dimension trust and leverage the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm for gathering consensus nodes into shards. Given the minimal possibility to be at fault in the security of validation, clients can achieve real-time processing speed with assurance. The evaluation results show that the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between the estimated reputation value and the real reputation value of our reputation scheme is less than 0.02.

Solving a PoW requires substantial amounts of time and energy, which are big concerns for UAVs.

For this reason, we designed and created an accreditation analytical model to investigate individual collected credentials from universities and examine candidates’ records of credibility using machine learning techniques and maintain all these aspects of analysis and addresses in the distributed storage with a secure hash-encryption (SHA-256) blockchain consortium network, which runs on a peer-to-peer (P2P) structure.

Sharing medical service records between different clinical jobs is a basic and testing research topic. The particular characteristics of blockchains have attracted a large amount of attention and resulted in revolutionary changes to various business applications, including medical care. A blockchain is based on a distributed ledger, which tends to improve cyber security. A number of proposals have been made with respect to the sharing of basic medical records using a blockchain without needing earlier information or the trust of patients. Specialist service providers and insurance agencies are not secure against data breaches. The safe sharing of clinical records between different countries, to ensure an incorporated and universal medical service, is also a significant issue for patients who travel. The medical data of patients normally reside on different healthcare units around the world, thus raising many concerns. Firstly, a patient’s history of treatment by different physicians is not accessible to the doctor in a single location. Secondly, it is very difficult to secure widespread data residing in different locations. This study proposed record sharing in a chain-like structure, in which every record is globally connected to the others, based on a blockchain under the suggestions and recommendations of the HL7 standards. This study focused on making medical data available, especially of patients who travel in different countries, for a specific period of time after validating the required authentication. Authorization and authentication are performed on the Shibboleth identity management system with the involvement of patient in the sanction process, thereby revealing the patient data for the specific period of time. The proposed approach improves the performance with respect to other record sharing systems, e.g., it reduces the time to read, write, delete, and revoke a record by a noticeable margin. The proposed system takes around three seconds to upload and 7.5 s to download 250 Mb of data, which can contain up to sixteen documents, over a stable network connection. The system has a latency of 413.76 ms when retrieving 100 records, compared to 447.9 and 459.3 ms in previous systems. Thus, the proposed system improved the performance and ensured seclusion by using a blockchain. © 2022 by the authors.

In particular, the development of mobile technology has made ubiquitous services possible. However, as technology advances, security is being emphasized more and more. The existing method of user authentication by entering an ID and password is likely to leak sensitive information if the server is attacked or keylogged. Therefore, multi-level authentication is needed to prevent server attacks or keylogging. Methods: Biometric authentication technology has been utilized by smartphones, but it is challenging to apply in the case of a lost device because the central server does not manage biometric data. Encrypting transactions through blockchain technology makes data management more secure because blockchain technology is distributed, and there is no primary target for hackers. Results: The method proposed in this study can become a basis for an authentication method that guarantees both security and integrity due to the synergetic use of biometric and blockchain technologies. Conclusions: The information stored in the service provider does not include sensitive information such as the user’s biometric data but is only a means of verifying the user’s information in the blockchain transaction with guaranteed anonymity. Therefore, users can receive services with confidence and safety. © 2022 by the authors.

Blockchain-based currencies or cryptocurrencies have become a global phenomenon known to most people as a disruptive technology, and a new investment vehicle. However, due to their decentralized nature, regulating these markets has presented regulators with difficulties in finding a balance between nurturing innovation, and protecting consumers. The growing concerns about illicit activity have forced regulators to seek new ways of detecting, analyzing, and ultimately policing public blockchain transactions. Extensive research on machine learning, and transaction graph analysis algorithms has been done to track suspicious behaviour. However, having a macro view of a public ledger is equally important before pursuing a more fine-grained analysis. Benford’s law, the law of first digit, has been extensively used as a tool to discover accountant frauds (many other use cases exist). The basic motivation that drove our research presented in this paper was to test the applicability of the well established method to a new domain, in this case the identification of anomalous behavior using Benford’s law conformity test to the cryptocurrency domain. The research focused on transaction values in all major cryptocurrencies. A suitable time-period was identified that was long enough to present sufficiently large number of observations for Benford’s law conformity tests and was also situated long enough in the past so that the anomalies were identified and well documented. The results show that most of the cryptocurrencies that did not conform to Benford’s law had well documented anomalous incidents, the first digits of aggregated transaction values of all well known cryptocurrency projects were conforming to Benford’s law. Thus the proposed method is applicable to the new domain. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Anomaly detection; Benford’s law; Cryptocurrency; Method application","非CCF推荐");

However, these schemes are incapable of traceability to the ciphertexts. In this paper, the ability of tracing to the ciphertexts is introduced into a PKEwET scheme. For the ciphertexts, the presented scheme supports not only the equality test, but also has the function of traceability. Meanwhile, the security of the proposed scheme is revealed by a game between an adversary and a simulator, and it achieves a desirable level of security. Depending on the attacker’s privileges, it can resist OW-CCA security against an adversary with a trapdoor, and can resist IND-CCA security against an adversary without a trapdoor.

Due to the characteristics of centralized management, the existing energy operation mode is difficult to simply apply to distributed energy resources transactions. The decentralization, transparency, contract execution automation and traceability of blockchain technology provide a new solution to the aggregation of decentralized resources and the opacity of transactions in VPP. In this paper, the existing problems of virtual power plants are analyzed, and the virtual power plant trading model is designed, which realizes the transparent benefit distribution and message transmission of virtual power plants. The virtual power plant blockchain network based on blockchain technology in this model solves the DERs coordination problem in VPP and the security and efficiency problems in information transmission. Combined with the actual situation of virtual power plant, the blockchain network collaboration mechanism (BNCM), which is convenient to reach agreement, is designed. Compared with the traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm, this mechanism can make DERs reach a consensus quickly. Finally, simulation experiments on the consensus algorithm show that the algorithm can reduce the collaboration time between DERs under the premise of ensuring the same fault tolerance rate and is more suitable for VPP scenarios with a large number of DERs. © 2022 by the authors.

We introduce Aurora-Trinity, a novel version of light clients that addresses the above-mentioned vulnerability by relying on our original Aurora module, which extends the Ethereum Trinity client. The Aurora module efficiently discovers the presence of malicious or Byzantine nodes in distributed ledger networks with a predefined and acceptable error rate and identifies at least one honest node for persistent or ephemeral communication. The identified honest node is used to detect the latest canonical chain head or to infer the state of an entry in the ledger without downloading the header chain, making the Aurora-Trinity client extremely efficient.

Patient records place in a block of the blockchain. Block of patient sends to other medical centers. Each treatment center can recommend the proposed type of treatment and blockchain attachment and send it to all nodes and treatment centers.

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is more suitable for consortium chain, which are partially decentralized, resistant to Byzantine nodes and strong consistency. However, the limited network scale that PBFT can support is not conducive to the large-scale development of consortium chain. Based on the analysis of the working principle and consensus mechanism of PBFT, this study proposed an algorithm to improve PBFT: feature grouping and credit optimization Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FCBFT). In this algorithm, a feature grouping model is proposed to optimize the node structure of large-scale consortium chain, which divides large-scale network nodes into different institutions to form independent consensus groups by feature grouping. On this basis, a reputation score reward mechanism is proposed to improve the consensus efficiency of large-scale consortium chains. It introduces a reputation score calculation formula to select high-reputation primary nodes. At the same time, a replacement cycle is established to replace high-reputation nodes with low-reputation nodes, so as to optimize the consensus efficiency of the consortium chain. The experimental results show that FCBFT has shorter delay and higher throughput (TPS) than PBFT, which becomes more obvious as the number of nodes increases. After the number of nodes exceeds the threshold, the TPS of PBFT drops rapidly, while FCBFT can maintain high efficiency and stability. FCBFT's block generation speed is higher than PBFT, and its relative growth rate has steadily increased. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Consensus algorithm; Consortium chain; Credit; Feature grouping; PBFTFault tolerance; Growth rate; Block-chain; Byzantine fault tolerance; Consensus algorithms; Consortium chain; Credit; Feature grouping; Improved * algorithm; Large-scales; Optimisations; Practical byzantine fault tolerance; Efficiency","B");

More often than not, IoT devices are designed for specific functional requirements or use cases without paying too much attention to security. Consequently, attackers usually compromise IoT devices with lax security to retrieve sensitive information such as encryption keys, user passwords, and sensitive URLs. Moreover, expanding IoT use cases and the exponential growth in connected smart devices significantly widen the attack surface. Despite efforts to deal with security problems, the security of IoT devices and the privacy of the data they collect and process are still areas of concern in research. Whenever vulnerabilities are discovered, device manufacturers are expected to release patches or new firmware to fix the vulnerabilities. There is a need to prioritize firmware attacks, because they enable the most high-impact threats that go beyond what is possible with traditional attacks. In IoT, delivering and deploying new firmware securely to affected devices remains a challenge.

Hence, we consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer (or two competing retailers), in which the supplier and the retailer can adopt blockchain technology to ensure credible product information. Two scenarios are developed – adopting blockchain technology (scenario B) or not (scenario N) – where the supplier needs to determine the information transparency level of the product. Our analysis shows that, in both monopoly and duopoly settings, as the maximum consumers’ willingness to pay increases, the total demand and the supplier's profit may decrease when the consumers’ transparency awareness is large. As the product cost increases, the supplier will increase the wholesale price while the retailer will reduce the retail price when consumers’ awareness of transparency level is in an intermediate range. And the supplier can mitigate the loss of increased product cost by increasing the transparency level if and only if the transparency cost in scenario B is large. The conditions for the adoption of blockchain technology are closely related to the reliability of information and the cost of transparency. Additionally, when the product cost is in an intermediate range or when the cost of transparency is small, subsidy promotes the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain system significantly.

A traditional solution is to designate a trusted time relay to provide time synchronization service for IoT. However, due to internal errors or external attacks, time synchronization services in IoT are facing the single point of failure, leading to severe consequences such as downtime of IoT devices across domains. Some centralized time synchronization methods, such as NTP and PTP, rely on the correctness of the time server (master clock), which is vulnerable due to crashes, power failure or external attacks. Most distributed schemes are oriented towards crash fault-tolerant, but the reality of Byzantine nodes prevents these schemes from working as expected. In this paper, we propose a distributed and verifiable time synchronization scheme based on NTP, trust management and blockchain. we employ the public and verifiable blockchain to identify incorrect time synchronization.

The analysis of a large amount of reviews data generated in the shopping process can be used to facilitate regulation: since the review data is short text and it is easy to extract the features through deep learning methods. Through these features, the sentiment analysis of the review data can be carried out to obtain the users’ emotional tendency for a specific product. Regulators can formulate reasonable regulation strategies based on the analysis results. However, the data has many issues such as poor reliability and easy tampering at present, which greatly affects the outcome and can lead regulators to make some unreasonable regulatory decisions according to these results. Blockchain provides the possibility of solving these problems due to its trustfulness, transparency and unmodifiable features. Based on these, the blockchain can be applied for data storage, and the Long short-term memory (LSTM) network can be employed to mine reviews data for emotional tendencies analysis. In order to improve the accuracy of the results, we designed a method to make LSTM better understand text data such as reviews containing idioms. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, different experiments were used for verification, with all results showing that the proposed method can achieve a good outcome in the sentiment analysis leading to regulators making better decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it, consuming huge computing resources, does not serve useful purpose beyond reaching a consensus. Recently, proof of useful work (PoUW) has been proposed to overcome the drawback of PoW. With PoUW, each miner spends almost all the time in doing useful work (e.g., data classification), and then competes for the winner by the number of its consumed CPU instructions. Therefore, the time of doing useful work is a salient factor which is newly introduced to PoUW. In this paper, focusing on the new factor, we first model the fork probability of PoUW and then quantify its system throughput. Our model takes into account various design parameters (including the time of doing useful work) and produces a closed-form expression of the system throughput. We then run extensive simulations that verify the accuracy and effectiveness of our theoretical model.

Energy sharing allows exchanging energy between the categories of consumers and prosumers in return for future benefits. FederatedGrids platform uses blockchain and federated learning to enable autonomous activities while providing trust and privacy among all participants.

Intensive research on the security of blockchain technology has been conducted, showing that security has become the most concerned topic in the blockchain realm, and consensus and smart contracts are the most vulnerable parts to be attacked. On account of this, we are concerned mainly in this review paper with security issues related to consensus and smart contracts.

Moreover, the proposed countermeasures to the security issues in consensus and smart contracts are also evaluated and discussed in a holistic manner.

The rapid expansion of e-auction enhances work efficiency but incurs some new and distinctive challenges such as low-robustness, data privacy, and lack of trust. To address the above concerns, various auction designs have been proposed by researchers from the academic and industrial circles. However, most of them fail in simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e. auctioneer-free), privacy-preserving (i.e. bids privacy), collusion-resistance, and secure-channel free. In this paper, we present an effective smart contract-based verifiable privacy-preserving sealed-bid reverse auction scheme, which not only has no need for trusted third parties, but also achieves robustness and privacy protection of losing bids even in the face of overwhelming collusion. In this scheme, the central auctioneer is replaced with some carefully designed smart contracts for decentralization, while zero-knowledge proof and anonymous veto networks are used to avoid the secret communication channel, support the public verifiability and detect the malicious behaviors of bidders. More practically, the complexity of the designed scheme is independent of the number of bidders. Finally, we implement a prototype of our design based on a locally simulated Ethereum test network.

To solve the unreliability problems of submitted reviews, this paper first proposes a blockchain-based identity authentication scheme and a new trusted service evaluation model by introducing the scheme into a service evaluation model. The new trusted service evaluation model consists of the blockchain-based identity authentication scheme, evaluation submission module, and evaluation publicity module. In the proposed evaluation model, only users who have successfully been authenticated can submit reviews to service vendors. The registration and authentication records of users' identity and the reviews for service vendors are all stored in the blockchain network.

The most important concerns of medical records in the medical field include data privacy, data correctness, and data security. By realizing these three goals, medical records can be made available to different hospital information systems to achieve the most complete medical care services. The privacy and protection of health data require detailed specification and usage requirements, which is particularly important for cross-agency data exchange. Methods: This research is composed of three main modules. "Combined Encryption and Decryption Architecture", which includes the hybrid double encryption mechanism of AES and RSA, and encrypts medical records to produce "Secured Encrypted Medical Record". "Decentralize EMR Repository", which includes data decryption and an exchange mechanism. After a data transmission is completed, the content verification and data decryption process will be launched to confirm the correctness of the data and obtain the data. A blockchain architecture is used to store the hash value of the encrypted EMR, and completes the correctness verification of the EMR after transmission through the hash value. Results: The results of this study provide an efficient triple encryption mechanism for electronic medical records. SEMRES ensures the correctness of data through the non-repudiation feature of a blockchain open ledger, and complete integrated information security protection and data verification architecture, in order that medical data can be exchanged, verified, and applied in different locations. After the patient receives medical services, the medical record is re-encrypted and verified and stored in the patient's medical record. The blockchain architecture is used to ensure the verification of non-repudiation of medical service, and finally to complete the payment for medical services. Conclusions: The main aim of this study was to complete a security architecture for medical data, and develop a triple encryption authentication architecture to help data owners easily and securely share personal medical records with medical service personnel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Data exchange; EMR Protection; Encryption; SecurityCryptography; Data privacy; Distributed ledger; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document exchange; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Block-chain; EMR protection; Hash value; Infectious disease outbreaks; Medical data; Medical record; Medical services; Non repudiation; Record exchange; Security; Blockchain; computer security; electronic health record; human; medical record; Blockchain; Computer Security; COVID-19; Electronic Health Records; Health Records, Personal; Humans; SARS-CoV-2","非CCF推荐");

However, they must address the nothing-at-stake problem, where a validator might attempt to sign off on competing blocks, with the hopes of earning coins regardless of which block becomes accepted as part of the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies such as Tendermint resolve this challenge by requiring validators to bond coins, which can be seized from a validator that is caught signing two competing blocks. Nevertheless, as the number of validators increases, it becomes increasingly infeasible to effectively monitor all validators, and to reach consensus. In this work, we incentivize proper block monitoring by allowing validators to form tontines. In the real world, tontines are financial agreements where payouts to each member increase as the number of members decreases. In our system, a tontine is a group of validators that monitor each other’s behavior, “murdering” any cheating tontine members to seize their stake. As the number of validators in a tontine is smaller than the number of validators in the currency as a whole, members can effectively police each other. We propose two methods whereby a Tendermint-like currency can be extended to allow for the creation of tontines: a pure PoS model, and a hybrid Proof-of-Stake/Proof-of-Work model. We describe snitch mechanisms for both the inter- and intra-tontine setting, argue our incentive mechanisms increase monitoring, and describe how it handles a variety of possible attacks. We extend our model to act as a validator delegated cryptocurrency, with the users having an incentive to partially participate. We show that these strategies may benefit validators as well as speed up the block formation process.

We find that blockchain-enabled booking apps that meet the following three conditions could attract up to half of the market: (1) offer discounts over OTAs, (2) provide services which go beyond mere booking, and (3) have well-known brand names. In a series of three nested logistic regressions, we investigate the impact of demographic, psychographic, and service-related traveler characteristics. We find that early adopters of blockchain-enabled hotel booking platforms will be young and highly educated. Potential cost savings over OTAs will also attract travelers with lower incomes and from larger households. Other traveler characteristics that facilitate adoption include a high preparedness to take risks, high IT innovativeness, prior familiarity with blockchain technology, and, mediated through IT innovativeness, a high Generalized Sense of Power.

However, large-scale extreme events may dismantle telecommunication infrastructures and impair rescue operations. The current state of practice to maintain communication when infrastructures are not operable mostly focuses on using temporary infrastructures including mobile telecom towers. However, these centralized solutions heavily depend on equipment that may not be readily available. To address this issue, this paper aims to create theoretical foundations for, and empirically examine the performance of, a novel decentralized and infrastructure-less communication system that uses an ad hoc mobile network, distributed ledger and Blockchain technology, and an all-to-all broadcasting routing algorithm. When the proposed communication system is used, mobile devices in the affected area connect with each other through device-to-device Wi-Fi Direct, create a temporary mobile ad hoc network, and share spatial information through the stepwise routing algorithm and distributed ledgers. At the end of this process, each device in the network will have spatial information of all available devices in the area. Therefore, when first responders arrive in the affected area, they can locate all devices and have access to all collected information immediately through a direct connection to only one device in the area.

Furthermore, they have a very active and dynamic ecosystem where new blockchain platforms and algorithms are developed continuously due to the interest of the public and the industries to the technology. Consequently, we anticipate a challenging and interdisciplinary research agenda in blockchain systems, built upon a methodology that strives to capture the rich process resulting from the interplay between the behavior of agents and the dynamic interactions among them.

However, it also incurs new privacy and security problems, as data is under a centralized third-party instead of the data owner's direct control. Existing data markets are also questioned on their inflexible and opaque pricing, where the value of data ownership and the cost of query searches are mixed. In this paper, we consider blockchain-based storage as a better choice to ensure safe data outsourcing since data is spread out across many data points. We propose an Ethereum-based data market that provides distributed storage and correct remote data search. We design a new pricing model, where each query will be charged by two parties: owner (paid for providing his data) and miner (rewarded by performing query searches). We study a new cooperative search scheme through a proxy to reduce cost on the user side. Given that each user query is charged based on its number of keywords, then a cooperative search can reduce user-side cost by combining multiple queries into a group so that overlapped keywords will only be charged for one time. To ensure user QoE, a combined query should not be significantly larger than any of its original queries in terms of the number of keywords. The total price is based on the total number of keywords in all groups.

Their appealing feature is to activate and dynamize the demand, supply, and development of digital goods, applications, or services. By being an intermediary between producer and consumer, the primary business model for a marketplace is to charge the producer with a commission on the amount paid by the consumer. However, most of the time, the commission is dictated by the marketplace facilitator itself and creates an imbalance in value distribution, where producer and consumer sides suffer monetarily. In order to eliminate the need for a centralized entity between the producer and consumer, a blockchain-based decentralized digital marketplace concept was introduced. It provides marketplace actors with the tools to perform business transactions in a trusted manner and without the need for an intermediary. In this work, we provide a survey on Telecommunication Services Marketplaces (TSMs) which employ blockchain technology as the main trust enabling entity in order to avoid any intermediaries. We provide an overview of scientific and industrial proposals on the blockchain-based online digital marketplaces at large, and TSMs in particular. We consider in this study the notion of telecommunication services as any service enabling the capability for information transfer and, increasingly, information processing provided to a group of users by a telecommunications system. We discuss the main standardization activities around the concepts of TSMs and provide particular use-cases for the TSM business transactions such as SLA settlement. Also, we provide insights into the main foundational services provided by the TSM, as well as a survey of the scientific and industrial proposals for such services.

Consequently, infrastructure providers (InPs) desire virtualized networks to share their subleased resources for effective resource management. Nonetheless, security and privacy challenges in the wireless network deter operators from collaborating with one another for resource trading. Lately, blockchain technology has received overwhelming attention for secure resource trading thanks to its security features. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework for blockchain-based resource trading among peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), for autonomous resource slicing in 5G RAN. Specifically, a consortium blockchain network that supports hyperledger smart contract (SC) is deployed to set up secure resource trading among seller and buyer MVNOs. With the aim of designing a fair incentive mechanism, we model the pricing and demand problem of the seller and buyers as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the seller MVNO is the leader and buyer MVNOs are followers. To achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the formulated game, a dueling deep Q-network (Dueling DQN) scheme is designed to achieve optimal pricing and demand policies for autonomous resource allocation at negotiation interval. Comprehensive simulation results analysis prove that the proposed scheme reduces double spending attacks by 12% in resource trading settings, and maximizes the utilities of players. The proposed scheme also outperforms deep Q-Network (DQN), Q-learning (QL) and greedy algorithm (GA), in terms of slice and system level satisfaction and resource utilization. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","5G; Blockchain; deep reinforcement learning; network slicing; resource trading; stackelberg game5G mobile communication systems; Blockchain; Commerce; Costs; Deep learning; Natural resources management; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Reinforcement learning; Sales; Scheduling; 5g.; Block-chain; Dynamic scheduling; Game; Network slicing; Resource management; Resource trading; Security; Stackelberg Games; Resource allocation","C");

Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm that incorporates the concept of Social Networking into the Internet of Things that paved the way to an area called Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) that is capable of autonomously establishing social relationships among other network participants for the overall system improvement. Due to the ad-hoc nature of the environment, it is hard to ensure the trustworthiness of the nodes to rely on the opinions, messages, and credibility of the message senders. We propose a Blockchain based reputation management system using Bayesian Inference approach for estimating the posterior probability of trustworthiness of each decision-making node in the network based on the decisions on incidents concerning the hypothesis. A dynamic weight learning mechanism of nodes and events is proposed for an efficient decision system. The proposed decision fusion algorithm is a novel voting mechanism based on the reputation of the node and the importance of the event. This approach uses Blockchain as a solution for identity management for node authorization and access control, and also for distributed storage of node reputation scores. The decision strategy of the proposed work outperforms other decision approaches such as simple majority voting, weighted voting, fuzzy rule-based inference, etc. The proposed approach out performs the state of the art trust management algorithms as discussed in results section, on the degree of punishment the propose algorithm offers to malicious activity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bayesian inference; Blockchain; Smart transportation; Trust management; Vehicular communicationAccess control; Bayesian networks; Blockchain; Decision making; Embedded systems; Fuzzy inference; Network security; Bayesian inference; Block-chain; Management applications; Reputation management; Smart transportation; Social-networking; Surveillance applications; Trust management; Vehicular communications; Vehicular networks; Internet of things","C");

They are significant addition to blockchain technology for achieving data transparency and reliability in maintaining the digital relationship between two or more entities. However, the smart contract is in its nascent stage and suffers from various limitations, including immutability and code secrecy. In this paper, we address the inability of smart contracts to access the on-chain data. The smart contract currently fetches the on-chain data by taking external oracle assistance, which can be compromised to influence the customers. To address the issue, we propose a decentralized mechanism for accessing the blockchain data directly from the smart contracts by indexing single or multiple parameters of a transaction in each block using the Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT). The idea is to increase the data transparency of blockchain applications. The paper provides a sequential search methodology that can retrieve transactions from N blocks, satisfying specific conditions, in O ( N ). The complexity is further reduced to O (N/k) by partitioning the blockchain data into k disjoint subsets to achieve parallelism in the search procedure.

Energy trade among the local energy generators (aka prosumers) and consumers can reduce the energy consumption cost and also reduce the dependency on conventional energy resources, not to mention the environmental, economic, and societal benefits. However, these local energy sources might not be enough to fulfill energy consumption demands. A hybrid approach, where consumers can buy energy from both prosumers (that generate energy) and also from prosumer of other locations, is essential. A centralized system can be used to manage this energy trading that faces several security issues and increase centralized development cost.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to create a hybrid energy trading platform over the smart contract for energy demand prediction.

BRPC integrates the confident-aware truth discovery algorithm to provide task requesters with reliable task truths while evaluating each worker's data quality. To mitigate the biased evaluation of malicious requesters, we propose a privacy-aware verification protocol leveraging the threshold Paillier cryptosystem, with which a certain number of workers can collaboratively verify the evaluation results without knowing any sensory data. Furthermore, we define the three roles of a user and elaborate a comprehensive reputation evaluation model enforced by smart contracts for its trustworthy running. Financial and social incentives are both offered to motivate users' honest participation. Finally, we implement a prototype of BRPC and deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. Theoretical analyses and experiment results show its security and practicality. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; crowdsourcing; privacy; truth discovery (TD); verifiabilityBlockchain; Privacy by design; Cost efficiency; Decentralized system; Discovery algorithm; Evaluation modeling; Evaluation results; Paillier cryptosystem; Trust assumptions; Verification protocol; Crowdsourcing","非CCF推荐");

An obligatory thing for the service provider is that they should push the service data safely and timely to multiple IoT terminal devices regularly after the IoT devices accomplishing the service subscription. In order to control the service message received by the legal devices as while as keep the confidentiality of the data, the public key encryption algorithm is utilized. While the existing public encryption algorithms for push service are too complicated for IoT devices, and almost of the current subscription schemes based on push mode are relying on centralized organization which may suffer from centralized entity corruption or single point of failure. To address these issues, we design a secure subscription-push service scheme based on blockchain and edge computing in this article, which is decentralized with secure architecture for the subscription and push of service. Furthermore, inspired by broadcast encryption and multicast encryption, a new encryption algorithm is designed to manage the permissions of IoT devices together with smart contract, and to protect the confidentiality of push messages, which is suitable for IoT devices. The edge computing nodes, in the new system architecture, maintain the blockchain to ensure the impartiality and traceability of service subscriptions and push messages, meanwhile undertake some calculations for IoT devices with limited computing power. The legalities of subscription services are guaranteed by verifying subscription tags on the smart contract. Lastly, the analysis indicates that the scheme is reliable, and the proposed encryption algorithm is safe and efficient.

Therefore, the accuracy and trustworthiness of messages transmitted in VANETs are essential, given that life may rely on them. VANETs are provided with basic security services through the use of public key infrastructure-based authentication. However, the trust of users is still an open issue in VANETs. It is important to prevent bogus message attacks from internal vehicles as well as protect vehicle privacy. In this paper, we propose a trust management scheme that ensures trust in VANETs while maintaining vehicle privacy. The trust scheme establishes trust between vehicles where a trust value is assigned to every vehicle based on its behavior and messages are accepted only from vehicles whose trust value is greater than a threshold, therefore, protecting VANETs from malicious vehicles and eliminating bogus messages. If a traffic event happens, vehicles upload event messages to the reachable roadside unit (RSU). Once the RSU has confirmed that the event happened, it announces the event to vehicles in its vicinity and records it into the blockchain. Using this mechanism, RSUs are prevented from sending fake or unverified event notifications. Simulations are carried out in the context of bogus message attacks to evaluate the trust scheme's reliability and efficiency. The results of the simulation indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared schemes and is highly resistant to bogus message attacks.

Interested users can purchase data from IoT device owners, according to their demands. However, users are not confident about the quality of data they are purchasing. Moreover, the users do not rely on the device owner and are not willing to initiate data trading. Currently, data trading systems have many drawbacks, as they involve a third party, security and reputation mechanisms. Therefore, in this article, IoTs and BlockChain (BC) are integrated to monetize IoT's data and provide trustful data trading. A BC based review system to monetize IoT's data trading is developed through Ethereum smart contracts. The review system encourages the owners to provide authentic data and solves the issues regarding data integrity, fake reviews and conflicts between entities. Reviews and ratings are stored in the BC database for providing a guarantee about the data quality to users. To maintain data integrity, we use an advanced encryption standard (AES)-256 encryption technique to encrypt data.

Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for efficient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust. © 2022 The Authors","Adversarial attack; Botnet detection; Federated learning; IoT device; IoT security5G mobile communication systems; Botnet; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Adversarial attack; Botnet detections; Centralised; Federated learning; IoT device; IoT security; Malicious participant; Malware detection; Model aggregations; Performance; Internet of things","B");

Moreover, a secure service provisioning scheme using cascading encryption and feature evaluation process is also proposed for the IoSTs. The presence of malicious nodes causes severe issues in the localization and service provisioning, which discourages new entities to join the network. Therefore, it is very important to establish trust between all entities by detecting and removing such nodes. The proposed B5G enabled malicious node detection model uses federated learning for the detection of malicious nodes. The federated learning uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the malicious nodes. The malicious nodes are classified on the bases of their honesty and end-to-end delay. Moreover, the service provider nodes provide services to each other and get the reward. However, the service provisioning in the IoSTs has many issues like a repudiation of service providers as well as the clients. The feature evaluation and cascading encryption mechanisms are used to solve these issues. The digital signature in cascading encryption ensures the non-repudiation of the service provider. On the other hand, feature evaluation of service ensures that the client cannot repudiate about actually demanded services. Moreover, the conformance of services is also ensured by the feature evaluation process. The simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed non-repudiation model. The SVM and RF classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall. The accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of SVM are 79%, 1, 0.8795 and 0.78, respectively. On the other hand, the accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of RF classifier are 95%, 0.92, 0.96 and 1, respectively.

Consequently, B5G-Driven edge computing allows a growing volume of data to be collected from and transmitted among pervasive edge devices for big data analytics. The collected big data becomes the driving force of artificial intelligence (AI) by training high-quality machine learning (ML) models, which is followed by severe individual privacy leakage. Federated learning(FL) is then proposed to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning by avoiding the exchange of raw data. Unfortunately, several major issues remain outstanding. Centralized processing costs significant communication resources between cloud and edge while data falsification problems persist. In addition, the private data may be reconstructed by malicious participants by exploiting the context of model parameters in FL. To solve the identified problems, we propose to integrate blockchain-enabled FL with Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) enabled differential privacy (DP) to protect the model parameters of edge devices in B5G networks. Blockchain enables decentralized FL to reduce communication costs between cloud and edge while alleviating the data falsification issues, and it also provides an incentive mechanism to alleviate the data island issue in B5G-Driven edge computing. WGAN is used to generate controllable random noise complying with DP requirements, which is then injected to model parameters. WGAN-enabled DP is able to achieve an optimized trade-off between differential privacy protection and improved data utility of model parameters.

To calculate the transaction fee, a computational unit, gas is introduced in smart contracts. Gas consumption is calculated against the smart contract source code execution. The transaction initiator sets the gas price against per unit of gas and the total gas limit. If the gas limit is sufficient, the transaction will be mined otherwise it will be reverted. Smart contracts of Ethereum can be written in any high-level language such as Solidity, Vyper, Python, Java and so forth, but Solidity is massively used for smart contracts creation.

Factors causing an increase or decrease in the gas consumption of smart contracts are highlighted in this article. The regression analysis showed that 87.8% of the variability in the response variable (gas consumption) is due to the parameters used in this analysis.

A group of mobile users is recruited with their smart devices to accomplish various sensing tasks in specific areas. The mobility and intelligence of mobile users enable MCS to achieve a sufficient coverage ratio of sensing tasks or areas. Currently, MCS is generally proposed and implemented in a centralized way under a platform's control. However, this centralized structure is vulnerable to a single point of failure. The platform's failure leads to a shutdown of the entire system. In addition, there is a trust issue between the platform and mobile users because of computational transparency and financial security. It is possible that the platform manipulates the working process of MCS to obtain an improper gain. To overcome these problems, we propose a decentralized MCS framework, named ChainSensing, by leveraging blockchain.

Since there are computationally intensive problems in ChainSensing, e.g., path planning, path selection, and reward determination, it is significantly expensive to solve such problems in blockchain. Therefore, we propose to leverage smart devices and computing oracles to solve these problems. Specifically, we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the path planning problem in smart devices of mobile users; we employ computing oracles to solve the path selection and reward determination problems. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations based on Ethereum to evaluate the performance of ChainSensing. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; decentralized framework; mobile crowdsensing (MCS); smart contractHeuristic algorithms; Computationally intensive problems; Coverage ratio; Financial security; Path planning problems; Path selection; Sensing tasks; Specific areas; Working process; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

In this vein, this article proposes a novel framework to empower fully distributed trustworthy SelfDNs across multiple domains.

By leveraging network-assisted device-to-device (D2D) collaboration, resource-constrained mobile devices are able to offload computation tasks to nearby resource-sharing mobile devices. Meanwhile, blockchain technology is developing rapidly and has been applied to mobile scenarios with massive information interaction for establishing trust between mobile devices. However, the computing power of mobile devices is limited by the physical size and battery capacity, which is not enough to cope with the high computation overhead for blockchain mining process. Thus, offloading mining tasks to the edge servers becomes a viable option. This paper investigates both of the D2D task offloading problem and the mining task offloading problem in a blockchain-enabled beyond 5G network. For the purpose of efficient resource allocation, the former is formulated as a double auction market and the latter is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Moreover, we propose two pricing based schemes to solve these two computation offloading problems, among which Bayes-Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibrium are analyzed. At last, by comparison with the benchmark, the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed schemes are evaluated.

However, we should address several challenges to facilitate the end-users finding and consuming the relevant services from the edge at the Internet scale. First, the scale and diversity of the edge hinder seamless access. Second, a framework where researchers openly share their services and data in a secured manner among themselves and with external consumers over the Internet does not exist. Third, the lack of a unified interface and trust across the service providers hinder their interchangeability in composing workflows by chaining the services. Thus, creating a workflow from the services deployed on the various edge nodes is presently impractical. This paper designs Viseu, a latency-aware blockchain framework to provide Virtual Internet Services at the Edge. Viseu aims to solve the puzzle of network service discovery at the edge, considering the peers’ reputation and latency when choosing the service instances. Viseu enables peers to share their computational resources, services, and data among each other in an untrusted environment, rather than relying on a set of trusted service providers. By composing workflows from the peers’ services, rather than confining them to the pre-established service provider and consumer roles, Viseu aims to facilitate scientific collaboration across the peers natively. Furthermore, by offering services from multiple peers close to the end-users, Viseu also minimizes end-to-end latency and data loss in the service execution at the Internet scale. © 2021 The Authors","Blockchain; Edge; Peer-to-peer networksBlockchain; Distributed computer systems; Internet service providers; Overlay networks; Trusted computing; Block-chain; Datacenter; Decentralized workflow; Edge; End-users; Latency-aware; Peer-to-peer networks; Service provider; Small scale; Work-flows; Peer to peer networks","B");

A non-interactive identity-based TPRE (IB-TPRE) scheme over lattices is proposed which removes the public key certificates. To accomplish this scheme, Shamir’s secret sharing is employed twice, which not only effectively hides the delegator’s private key information, but also decentralizes the proxy power by splitting the re-encryption key. Robustness means that a combiner can detect a misbehaving proxy server that has sent an invalid transformed ciphertext share. This property is achieved by lattice-based fully homomorphic signatures. As a result, the whole scheme is thoroughly capable of resisting quantum attacks even when they are available.

Most smart contracts do not publish the source code, but only the bytecode. Based on the research of bytecode similarity of smart contract, smart contract upgrade, vulnerability search and malicious contract analysis can be carried out. The difficulty of bytecode similarity research is that different compilation versions and optimization options lead to the diversification of bytecode of the same source code. This paper presents a solution, including a series of methods to measure the similarity of smart contract bytecode. Starting from the opcode of smart contract, a method of pre-training the basic block sequence of smart contract is proposed, which can embed the basic block vector. Positive samples were obtained by basic block marking, and the negative sampling method is improved. After these works, we put the obtained positive samples, negative samples and basic blocks themselves into the triplet network composed of transformers. Our solution can obtain evaluation results with an accuracy of 97.8%, so that the basic block sequence of optimized and unoptimized options can be transformed into each other. At the same time, the instructions are normalized, and the order of compiled version instructions is normalized. Experiments show that our solution can effectively reduce the bytecode difference caused by optimization options and compiler version, and improve the accuracy by 1.4% compared with the existing work.

In this paper, we propose an asynchronous federated learning system based on permissioned blockchains, using permissioned blockchains as the federated learning server, which is composed of a main-blockchain and multiple sub-blockchains, with each sub-blockchain responsible for partial model parameter updates and the main-blockchain responsible for global model parameter updates. Based on this architecture, a federated learning asynchronous aggregation protocol based on permissioned blockchain is proposed that can effectively alleviate the synchronous federated learning algorithm by integrating the learned model into the blockchain and performing two-order aggregation calculations. Therefore, the overhead of synchronization problems and the reliability of shared data is also guaranteed. We conducted some simulation experiments and the experimental results showed that the proposed architecture could maintain good training performances when dealing with a small number of malicious nodes and differentiated data quality, which has good fault tolerance, and can be applied to edge computing scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.

As the bridge between blockchains and port supply chains, smart contracts reconstruct the business process of blockchain‐empowered port supply chains. In this article, we present an architecture of a consortium blockchain‐empow-ered port supply chain system, and propose a system verification framework for the smart contracts of port supply chains with probabilistic behaviors.

The requirements are specified by PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic).

In the framework, a collaborative mining process is designed, where we consider the cooperation between mobile devices (MDs) and MEC servers. To promote mining efficiency, we further develop a high-performance consensus mechanism called reputation-based proof of work (Re-PoW), in which differentiated mining targets are assigned according to the reputation of MDs. In the Re-PoW consensus mechanism, heterogeneous capabilities and historical behaviors of MDs are all considered for accurately evaluating their reputation.

Different from general programs, smart contracts are decentralized, tamper-resistant and permanently running. Moreover, to avoid resource abuse, Ethereum charges users for deploying and invoking smart contracts according to the size of contract and the operations executed by contracts. It is necessary to optimize smart contracts to save money. However, since developers are not familiar with the operating environment of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum virtual machine) or do not pay attention to resource consumption during development, there are many optimization opportunities for smart contracts. To fill this gap, this paper defines six gas-inefficient patterns from more than 25 000 posts and proposes an optimization approach at the source code level to let users know clearly where the contract is optimized. To evaluate the prevalence and economic benefits of gas-inefficient patterns, this paper conducts an empirical study on more than 160 000 real smart contracts.

Nevertheless, secure data sharing is a principal patient’s concern to be comfort to use such systems. Current HCS are not able to provide reassuring security policies. For that, one of our focus in this work, is to provide security countermeasures, likewise cost-efficient solution for HCS by integrating storage model based on Blockchain and Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). Blockchain technology is an emerging solution in pharmaceutical industry and starts to take place for HCS and allows HealthCare providers to track connected devices and control access to shared data, hence protecting patients’ privacy. Furthermore, the addition of Edge and Fog computing has improved HCS to react in real-time and enhance their reliability. A variety of communication protocols can connect sensor devices to edge/Fog layer and the best choice will depend upon connectivity requirements: range, bandwidth, power, interoperability, security, and reliability.

Digital evidence is complicated, diffuse, volatile, and easily altered, and as such, it must be protected. The Chain of Custody (CoC) is a critical component of the digital evidence procedure. The aim of the CoC is to demonstrate that the evidence has not been tampered with at any point throughout the investigation. Because the uncertainty associated with digital evidence is not being assessed at the moment, it is impossible to determine the trustworthiness of CoC. As scientists, forensic examiners have a responsibility to reverse this tendency and officially con-front the uncertainty inherent in any evidence upon which they base their judgments. To address these issues, this article proposes a new paradigm for ensuring the integrity of digital evidence (CoC documents). The new paradigm employs fuzzy hash within blockchain data structure to handle uncertainty introduced by error-prone tools when dealing with CoC documents. Traditional hashing techniques are designed to be sensitive to small input modifications and can only determine if the inputs are exactly the same or not. By comparing the similarity of two images, fuzzy hash functions can determine how different they are. With the symmetry idea at its core, the suggested framework effectively deals with random parameter probabilities, as shown in the development of the fuzzy hash segmentation function. We provide a case study for image forensics to illustrate the usefulness of this framework in introducing forensic preparedness to computer systems and ena-bling a more effective digital investigation procedure. © 2022 by the authors.

Furthermore, they do not enable learners to own, control, and share their e‐portfolio information across organizations, which increases the risk of forged and fraudulent credentials.

Providing a low computational cost with high serving capability, however, is a critical phenomenon in the current VANET system. In the existing scenario, when the authenticated vehicle user moves from one roadside unit (RSU) to another RSU region, re-authentication of the vehicle user is required by the current RSU, which increases the computational complexity. To overcome the above-mentioned challenge, a blockchain-based authentication protocol is developed in this work. In this suggested process, blockchain is integrated with VANET, which enables the authentication of the vehicle user without the involvement of a trusted authority. Moreover, the integrity of the message and privacy of vehicle users are preserved in the blockchain network. Even though many blockchain-based schemes have been proposed recently, the existing schemes were not focused on conditional anonymity. However, in our proposed scheme, conditional privacy is introduced to revoke the malicious vehicles in the case of disputes and to avoid further damage to the VANET system.

Wireless sensor networks are used in these Internet of things applications. Playing a vital role, the upload of data requires multiple layers of transmission to reach the cloud. In the industrial control field, many IoT devices upload data to the cloud for storage, but the upload process is easily tampered with, and centralized cloud services also have security concerns. In addition, in the local IoT perception layer among them, the security of sensor identity verification is also very important for message transmission. The main reason why the past blockchain technology could not be widely used in industrial control and other application fields is the cost considerations, because the procedures for running blockchain nodes and uploading transactions are too expensive. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoT architecture based on the IOTA Tangle network to solve the centralization problem of IoT storage in the cloud, and uses the method of MAM (Masked Authenticated Message) to trace the information of WSNs, while achieving data security and data preservation. In the edge devices of WSNs, because of the insufficient memory and computing performance of many devices, it is impossible to perform proof of work calculations. Therefore, this paper uses the logical key hierarchy-based method to manage the sensors, and applies symmetric and asymmetric encryption in blockchain. The identity verification of the device can be effectively achieved, and the operating cost can be effectively reduced. © 2022 by the authors.

In parallel, there is rapid development in cloud computing technology, introducing a cloudbased AI system. Unfortunately, the vulnerabilities in cloud computing will also affect the security of AI services. We observe that compromising the training data integrity means compromising the results in the AI system itself. From this background, we argue that it is essential to keep the data integrity in AI systems. To achieve our goal, we build a data integrity architecture by following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework guidance. We also utilize blockchain technology and smart contracts as a suitable solution to overcome the integrity issue because of its shared and decentralized ledger. Smart contracts are used to automate policy enforcement, keep track of data integrity, and prevent data forgery. First, we analyze the possible vulnerabilities and attacks in AI and cloud environments. Then we draw out our architecture requirements. The final result is that we present five modules in our proposed architecture that fulfilled NIST framework guidance to ensure continuous data integrity provisioning towards secure AI environments. © 2022 by the authors.

With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps. © 2022 by the authors.","Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preservedCryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; Blockchain; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity","非CCF推荐");

When operating SLAM in multi-drone scenarios, collecting and sharing the map data and deriving converged maps are major issues (regarded as the bottleneck of the system). This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes the concepts of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for enabling the online map convergence of multiple drones without a centralized station. As DLT allows each agent to secure a collective database of valid transactions, DLT-powered SLAM can let each drone secure global 3D map data and utilize these data for navigation. However, block-based DLT—a so called blockchain—may not fit well to the multi-drone SLAM due to the restricted data structure, discrete consensus, and high power consumption. Thus, we designed a multi-drone SLAM system that constructs a DAG-based map database and sifts the noisy 3D points based on the DLT philosophy, named DAGmap. Considering the differences between currency transactions and data constructions, we designed a new strategy for data organization, validation, and a consensus framework under the philosophy of DAG-based DLT.

Blockchain allows digital transactions between two parties without a third party as a broker. Blockchain is now applicable beyond fintech to various other industries. Among these, Hyperledger fabric has emerged as the most popular blockchain-based open-source permissioned platform targeting business applications. It has been used in over 400 proofs-of-concept blockchain and is well proven in applications, such as supply chain, healthcare, and so on. Despite the many obvious benefits observed in blockchain-enhanced platforms, there still exist technical challenges in scalability, causing performance deficiency, which includes latency and throughput. There is an exigent need to improve the current blockchain-based applications to have the blockchain nodes be scalable without compromising the blockchain performance. In this study, we present the impact of workload variance of up to 1000 transactions with the setup of 20 blockchain nodes in the Hyperledger LTS platform. The evaluation metrics are transaction success and failure rate, throughput, and latency in the blockchain. The transaction throughput was found to be consistent with the increasing workload on a constant number of nodes. However, it showed a declining trend with an increasing number of nodes. As far as the latency, it was in tandem with the increased workload and the number of nodes.

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a reputation-driven dynamic node security sharding consensus model (RDSCM) in the blockchain, which consists of two parts: a reputation-driven node to eliminate PBFT (RE-PBFT) and a reputation-driven node cross reconfiguration sharding scheme (NCRS). The RE-PBFT eliminates abnormal nodes in the consensus network and reduces the probability of abnormal nodes becoming master nodes. NCRS improves the blockchain throughput while ensuring sharding reliability. Finally, the experiment proves that RE-PBFT can identify abnormal nodes and remove them in a short time.

DDESS adopts the idea of a zero-trust network, with identity authentication as the core for access control, which solves security problems of traditional IP networks. In addition, DDESS achieves individual static security defense through encryption and decryption, consortium blockchain, trusted computing whitelist, and remote attestation strategies. At the same time, with the dynamic collection of data traffic and access logs, as well as the understanding and prediction of the situation, DDESS can realize the situation awareness of network security and the cultivation of immune vaccines against unknown network attacks, thus achieving the active herd defense of network security. © 2022 by the authors.

However, current cross-chain approaches mainly rely on smart contracts with essential pre-deployment steps, several of which need to be synchronized, resulting in low performance. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous cross-chain exchange model based on a transaction that embeds a control condition to determine whether to transfer assets. The condition is used to specify the paired transaction. In order to find which cross-chain transaction meets the condition, the fields of cross-chain transactions are compared mutually, including sender, receiver, value, blockchain identifier, etc. Meanwhile, the balance process in the blockchain consensus needs to be changed: subtracting the balance of the sender first, increasing the balance of the receiver when the conditions match, or returning the assets to the sender if the time expires. By embedding conditions in transactions, the step of pre-deploying smart contracts is eliminated, and transactions can be sent in parallel. The simulation results show that compared with smart contract-based method, the exchange waiting time is reduced by up to 73.4%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conditional transaction; Cross-chain; Cross-chain exchange; Transaction dependence'current; Block-chain; Chain exchange; Condition; Conditional transaction; Cross-chain; Cross-chain exchange; Exchange models; Performance; Transaction dependence; Smart contract","C");

However, the traditional blockchain system uses Merkle trees to store data, in which the proof size is large when verifying the integrity and correctness of the data.

Even though it brings several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller. Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN's Northbound. Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations, we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts.

To this end, decision-makers are becoming increasingly interested in applying disruptive technologies to address societal, environmental, and economic concerns and accomplish sustainability goals. Researchers argue that disruptive technologies such as blockchain may be implemented to assist supply chains towards building sustainability.

Using this framework, the critical functions of a SSC were ranked against the benefits of blockchain. The findings of this study implied that while sourcing, delivery, transformation and product recovery proved to be the most appropriate functions of SSCs for blockchain applications, customers and product use was the least feasible one.

It involves obtaining information and opinions from a group of participants who submit their data (i.e., solutions) via the Internet using some applications. The application domains, where crowdsourcing can be used, include, but not limited to, healthcare, environment, public safety, disaster management, and transportation. Despite the unprecedented advantages of crowdsourcing, security and privacy are rising concerns that need to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucially important to provide effective solutions that address the security and privacy issues in crowdsourcing systems. To this end, the salient features of blockchain technology such as immutability, decentralization, transparency and resiliency can play a pivotal role to address the afore-mentioned security challenges.

With blockchain technology, rode-side unit (RSU) and on-board units (OBUs) within its communication range can negotiate a group key without private information leakage.

Unfortunately, when such a permissioned blockchain runs on a large scale on the Internet, these explicit committee nodes can be easily turned down by denial-of-service (DoS) or network partition attacks. Although recent studies proposed scalable BFT protocols that run on a larger number of committee nodes, these protocols’ efficiency drops dramatically when only a small number of nodes are attacked. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol named EGES that leverages hardware trusted execution environments (e.g., Intel SGX) to develop a new abstraction called “stealth committee”, which effectively hides a committee into a large pool of fake committee nodes. EGES selects a different stealth committee for each block and confirms the same blocks among all nodes with overwhelming probability. Our evaluation shows that EGES is the first efficient permissioned blockchain's consensus protocol, which simultaneously satisfies two important metrics: (1) EGES can tolerate tough DoS and network partition attacks; and (2) EGES achieves comparable throughput and latency as existing fastest permissioned blockchains’ consensus protocols.

As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus number, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process—the account owner—can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is 1. We then consider a more general k-shared asset transfer object where up to k processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number k. We establish our results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message passing setting with Byzantine players, a model that is more relevant in practice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions.

To provide a more comprehensive and reliable privacy-preserving scheme, this paper proposes a novel credit evaluation system with secure sharing and multiparty computation based on blockchain. The system consists of five modules: data, access control, data encryption, secure computation and model storage modules. The Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based data module ensures the authenticity and traceability of the data source. The raw data are encrypted by a linear transformation algorithm in the data encryption module, which minimizes the output and utilization of data when leaving local storage and prevents potential privacy leakage in data sharing to the greatest extent. The phillie homomorphic encryption-based secure computation algorithm in the secure computation module achieves secure data sharing while applying the secure multiparty computation, which makes it possible to data sharing and privacy protection in multiparty computing. The system obtains final summary statistical results without exposing the raw data. Additionally, the final statistical results of the raw data can be inferred from the encrypted data, and their results are consistent. The correctness and accuracy of the linear conversion encryption mechanism and homomorphic encryption algorithm are proven by theoretical analysis.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are a mechanism to communicate and enforce such guarantees typically represented as service level objectives (SLOs), and financial penalties are imposed on SLO violations. Due to delays and inaccuracies caused by manual processing, an automatic method to periodically verify SLA terms in a transparent and trustworthy manner is fundamental to effective SLA monitoring, leading to the acceptance and credibility of such service to the customers of cloud services. This paper presents a blockchain-based distributed infrastructure that leverages fundamental blockchain properties to achieve immutable and trustworthy SLA monitoring within cloud services. The paper carries out an in-depth empirical investigation for the scalability of the proposed system in order to address the challenge of transparently enforcing real-time monitoring of cloud-hosted services leveraging blockchain technology. This will enable all the stakeholders to enforce accurate execution of SLA without any imprecisions and delays by maintaining an immutable ledger publicly across blockchain network. The experimentation takes into consideration several attributes of blockchain which are critical in achieving optimum performance. The paper also investigates key characteristics of these factors and their impact to the behaviour of the system for further scaling it up under various cases for increased service utilization. © 2021, The Author(s).","Permissioned blockchain; Scalability; SLO monitoring; Smart contract; Web service monitoringBlockchain; Cloud computing; Monitoring; Quality of service; Scalability; Web services; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Permissioned blockchain; Service level agreement monitoring; Service level objective; Service level objective monitoring; Service monitoring; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Web service monitoring; Webs services; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

However, only a few works have been done focusing on authentication and key establishment for blockchain-based smart grid (SG) under fog environment. Thus, this paper introduces a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for blockchain and fog computing based SG environment. Unlike the existing schemes that depend on single trusted authorities for storage and computation tasks, the proposed scheme reduces this dependency by creating a blockchain-based distributed environment assisted by cloud servers and fog nodes. In addition, a secure and shared key is established among smart meter, fog node, and cloud server to achieve message confidentiality between them. A detailed formal and informal security analysis proves that the proposed protocol is secure under the RoR model and achieves the predefined security goals. The blockchain and cryptographic operations are evaluated using hyperledger fabric and cryptographic libraries, respectively.

Instead of keeping investing in costly cloud infrastructures, trading resources among different cloud service providers is another cost-effective way to expand the capacity. The key is to design an effective market-based mechanism to facilitate resource trading and motivate high-quality service provisioning. This paper proposes a distributed Feedback-based Combinatorial Multi-unit Double Auction mechanism backed by blockchain to establish a cloud resource market that not only produces high social welfare but also motivates participants to provide high-quality service. We first design an improved greedy allocation mechanism with a novel sorting method to achieve high social welfare. Then we propose a feedback-based second-price pricing mechanism to limit strategic manipulation. Finally, we design a feedback system combined with the auction mechanism to motivate high-quality service provisioning. All these mechanisms are implemented in the form of smart contracts on a consortium blockchain which guarantees the effectiveness of the feedback system and eliminates the dependence on a central auctioneer. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed auction mechanism maintains budget balance, individual rationality, truthfulness on the buyer side and computational efficiency. In comparison with other popular mechanisms, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate higher efficiency of the allocation mechanism, good limitation on strategic manipulation of the pricing mechanism and effectiveness of the feedback system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Combinatorial double auction mechanism; Feedback; Resource allocation; Resource pricingBudget control; Cloud computing; Commerce; Computational efficiency; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Efficiency; Quality of service; Smart contract; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Combinatorial double auction mechanism; Combinatorial double auctions; Double auction mechanism; Feed-back based; Feedback systems; High quality service; Resource pricing; Resources allocation; Blockchain","C");

The unavoidably captured sensitive visuals via these cameras may raise significant security concerns, while the prevalent software defects and authentication misconfiguration issues aggravate the vulnerability of such devices.

In this context, realizing accountability for these surveillance systems shall be the last line of defense in the presence of fast-evolving and high-influential threats. We propose EviChain, a scalable blockchain-based solution to trace the operations on intelligent surveillance cameras and reserve the evidence for any misuse in tamper-proofing manipulation records. Building a blockchain over the distributed cameras is challenging due to the limited capacity of on-board memory. To tackle this challenge, we design a cooperative mechanism that enables cameras to adaptively join in groups and share storage for recording blocks.

Due to these immense growths, the concern raises in critical transaction records in terms of system security threats and efficiency issues in the smart devices. However, existing methods failed due to security attacks during the tenure of access transactions and aggregated services. Recently, blockchain technology enables service centers depends on various platforms to share transaction records. But, it is difficult to store the transaction record because of its size. To address these issues, we proposed a SECure LearningChain (SEC-LearningChain) design based on the integration of blockchain technology, machine learning (ML), and cloud computing primitives are applied together for a secure data transaction in a Peer to Peer network as well as efficient data sharing service. This approach consists of four design models: First, an attack detection model detects the attack using threshold-based anomalous traffic detector in the transaction network. Second, a mold blockchain transaction network model is designed based on the cryptographic hash and encryption to deal with threats and validate the identity verification process for a secure transaction. Next, the large-scale transaction record is optimized and trains the ML model for the output prediction. Finally, the cloud assessment model manages the stored transaction records and easily share the accessed services across different cloud platforms for each service center. Furthermore, we prove that the SEC-LearningChain design resists transmission control protocol flooding attack, denial of service attack, and falsify attack.

The Earth bound DTN has been dedicated to connecting remote, heterogeneous, fluctuating, mobile and undisciplined networks like sensor, military and disaster struck areas. The Homing Pigeon Based DTN (HoP-DTN), a variant of DTN, was specifically conceptualized to serve some of these networks whose characteristics are different from the general delay or disruption tolerant networks. HoP-DTN uses special message carrying nodes, pigeons, to proactively route messages around the network. As it works in areas like disaster response or military, energy conservation is imperative here. Till now providing a solution to this energy issue has been lacking in HoP-DTN. Also routing in HoP-DTN is a Traveling Salesman Problem. This paper proposes a 4-step mechanism to address both of these issues. In view of that some changes to the classical modeling of HoP-DTN has been done to accommodate the variations. The deployment area has been divided into zones with pigeons following a 4-step detailed course plan and scheduling strategy to achieve better routing and more energy efficiency.

To address this, few researchers with the adaption of blockchain technology and practical usage of a privacy-preserving smart contract as group controller made these group key agreements adaptable to WANET. However, proportionate to the increase in the size of the group, the processing load on the smart contract is also increasing, which made the capability of the smart contract could not work beyond a certain group size. Contemporary blockchain schemes suffer from various inherent shortcomings in their latency, scalability, and processing throughput. So, in this direction, we adopted blockchain sharding smart contract-centric processing for making the key agreement adaptable to large WANETs. In this technique, we divide the large network into r sharded subnetworks with G1, G2, G3, …, Gr as smart contract instances generated by group controller G, which acts as subgroup controllers to their respective shards using blockchain sharding technique.

Threshold signature techniques were employed to reduce communication complexity. In that way, nodes from other groups only needed to communicate with the committee nodes of the current group, thus greatly reducing the average communication delay.

The early detection, isolating the infected persons and tracing possible contacts are very critical. This paper presents an integrated approach that connects hospitals/laboratories, COVID-19 negative persons, positive persons, and contact persons to a cloud-based consortium blockchain system to guarantee reliable secured COVID-19 spread control. The proposed model guarantees a real time monitoring, tracking, and updating to persons status whether normal, contact, or positive COVID-19 case, and the related updates are done in the blockchain based on the results of execution of the blockchain smart contract rules. Tracking infected persons and their contacts is implemented using IoT sensors to determine contact time and spatial distances between them. The GPS/Bluetooth/UWB was used as IoT sensors technologies to determine the distances between the infected people and those in contact. The proposed blockchain Ethereum system smart contract was implemented by solidity programming language through the Remix IDE.

It is challenging to determine the transaction execution order using the existing blockchains because they lack the ability to record and execute associations between assets, which results in problems of inconsistency of assets, such as the loss of asset status changes and status conflict between transactions. This study proposes a blockchain-native mechanism supporting complex physical assets, including a novel digital asset model and transaction validity guarantee protocol. Under the premise of ensuring safety and performance, the proposed mechanism can fully describe different associations and their influence on the transaction execution order. This study builds a global deterministic transaction execution sequence that can be executed in parallel to guarantee the consistency of complex digital assets based on partial orders. Theoretical analysis of the proposed mechanism demonstrates that it can guarantee digital asset consistency and can protect against attacks such as reentrant and transaction sequence attacks.

Being virtual and decentralized, cryptocurrencies are convenient, fast, and transparent. They are generally considered secure due to their foundation in cutting-edge blockchain technology. However, despite their inherent security safeguards, it is now been realized that cryptocurrencies are not completely secure against criminals. Individual users, wallet providers, and cryptocurrency exchanges have all been targeted by cybercriminals. Furthermore, regardless of the current or prospective financial standing of cryptocurrencies, the question of how existing national legislation will apply to cryptocurrencies remains unresolved. Cybercriminals exploit cryptocurrencies in several ways, utilizing them as both a tool and a target. On such a basis this article seeks to address and analyze factors surrounding the cyber-attack risks associated with cryptocurrencies. It is discussed how cryptocurrencies are being used for money laundering and payment for illegal services and goods on the Dark Web, and are becoming a target for hacking, phishing, malware, extortion, and ransomware.

Unfortunately, current research of data backup mainly focuses on improving data recovery efficiency, and rarely takes backups confidentiality and service DDoS attacks resistance into consideration, which greatly limits their usability in practice. In this work, we propose a novel data backup scheme called RAP (RAnsomware Protection scheme based on blockchain) to make up for the above deficiencies. Based on the principle of data isolation, we first formally discuss the role of gateways in data backup systems and deploy mechanism on gateways to resist DDoS attacks. RAP employs an optimized all-or-nothing transform (AONT) and offers the scheme for setup, backups upload and data recovery through secure channel. We define and analyze the security of RAP for data confidentiality and DDoS attacks resistance. We instantiate RAP by a consortium blockchain based on Ethereum and evaluate its performance. The running time of each phase in RAP is less than 1 millisecond excluding the read/write delay of typic data size and our scheme would be compatible with most existing blockchains, which further demonstrate its practicality and scalability. © 2022 IEEE.","backup; blockchain; component; confidentiality; DDoS attacks; ransomware; service availabilityBlockchain; Malware; Network security; Backup; Block-chain; Component; Confidentiality; Data backups; Data loss; Data recovery; DDoS Attack; Protection schemes; Services availability; Denial-of-service attack","非CCF推荐");

Using blockchain to detect DDoS attacks is one of the current popular methods. However, the problems of high time overhead and cost exist in the most of the blockchain methods for detecting DDoS attacks. This paper proposes a blockchain-based collaborative detection method for DDoS attacks. First, the trained DDoS attack detection model is encrypted by the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which provides high security for uploading the DDoS attack detection model to the blockchain. Secondly, the service provider uploads the encrypted model to Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) and then a corresponding Content-ID (CID) is generated by IPFS which greatly saves the cost of uploading encrypted models to the blockchain. In addition, due to the small amount of model data, the time cost of uploading the DDoS attack detection model is greatly reduced. Finally, through the blockchain and smart contracts, the CID is distributed to other service providers, who can use the CID to download the corresponding DDoS attack detection model from IPFS. Blockchain provides a decentralized, trusted and tamper-proof environment for service providers. Besides, smart contracts and IPFS greatly improve the distribution efficiency of the model, while the distribution of CID greatly improves the efficiency of the transmission on the blockchain. In this way, the purpose of collaborative detection can be achieved, and the time cost of transmission on blockchain and IPFS can be considerably saved. We designed a blockchain-based DDoS attack collaborative detection framework to improve the data transmission efficiency on the blockchain, and use IPFS to greatly reduce the cost of the distribution model. In the experiment, compared with most blockchain-based method for DDoS attack detection, the proposed model using blockchain distribution shows the advantages of low cost and latency. The remote authentication mechanism of Intel SGX provides high security and integrity, and ensures the availability of distributed models. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

Subsequently, according to the auction policies, the transaction center determines the transaction match pairs and publish them. If a bidder is matched, he can offer a verification token to open his identity and prove he is the owner of the matched bid. When a participant complains about the result of the transaction, every participant can check the validity of complains.

In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning framework for secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving computational intelligence, called Decentralized Computational Intelligence as a Service (DCIaaS), is proposed. The proposed framework is able to improve data quality, computational intelligence quality, data equality, and computational intelligence equality for complex machine learning tasks. The proposed framework uses the blockchain network for secure decentralized transfer and sharing of data and machine learning models on the cloud. As a case study for multimedia applications, the performance of DCIaaS framework for biomedical image classification and hazardous litter management is analysed. Experimental results show an increase in the accuracy of the models trained using the proposed framework compared to decentralized training.

Many electricity suppliers are engaged in efforts to monetize this transition with ‘green’ services and products, such as Green Electricity Tariffs. These promise customers that their supply includes a specific share of green electricity, yet since electricity suppliers often fail to deliver on those promises, many customers have lost trust in their suppliers. Further information asymmetries may not only exacerbate this loss of trust, but also spark distrust and lead to an overall feeling of ambivalence. Eventually, ambivalent customers may feel inclined to switch suppliers. To prevent this domino effect, electricity suppliers must eliminate ambivalence by increasing customer trust and reducing customer distrust.

After its discovery in China in late 2019, the virus spreads fiercely through various social transmissions, causing more than 60 million confirmed cases and close to 1.9 million deaths by early 2021. On 11th March 2020, the WHO went on to declare the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. To lessen societal pressure and restore normalcy, many countries committed to vaccination have introduced the COVID-19 immunity passports, certificates, or licenses, collectively called the COVID-19 immunity certificate. This is to legally certify that the certificate bearer has been vaccinated and is immune to COVID-19. However, there exists several practical and legal obstacles to efficiently track/trace the certificates. Matter of fact, this kind of certificate is to impose restrictions on who can and who cannot participate in an official social activity. This has regrettably promoted the fabrication of the certificate and is casting doubt on the vaccination integrity. In this paper, we thus propose a novel blockchain-based system for establishing trust on the certificate bearer and to eradicate vaccination immunity certificate fraud. Our proposed system is aimed to address the issues in trackability, and traceability of the data embedded in the immunity certificate. This is to uphold the trust on the certificate bearer/holder that all necessary precautions pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination have been legally obeyed and complied with.

The source, authenticity, and integrity of medical waste data lack guarantees, and there is a risk of data tampering and forgery. Although there are currently some medical waste supervision applications combined with IoT-based blockchain domestically and internationally to facilitate information sharing and transfer, no verifiable method is provided for the information privacy leakage of medical waste operators. To address this problem, we propose a blockchain-based medical waste supervision model, which connects participants involved in the process, introduces digital credentials to achieve the protection of operator information privacy, and ensures that the entire data process is authentic and credible. By building a decentralized system architecture and setting intelligent contracts, we integrate and record the medical waste disposal regulatory information in different phases on the blockchain to form the supervision of medical waste chain.

Then, how to motivate the data owners to participate federated learning and contribute high-quality data is the crucial issue. In this paper, a blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) with a reputation mechanism for high-quality model aggregation is proposed. Specifically, the blockchain transforms the federated learning into a decentralized and trustworthy manner. Over the blockchain, federated learning tasks, undertaken by smart contracts, can be conducted transparently and fairly. Besides, a reputation-constrained data contribution and reward allocation mechanism is designed to encourage data owners to participate in BFL and contribute high-quality data. The non-cooperative game is adopted to analyze the behavior strategies of data owners. The existence of the unique equilibrium is proved and the equilibrium point indicates that the data owners can acquire highest reward with contribution of highest quality data. Thus, the model quality of BFL is guaranteed.

Blockchain technology acquires transparency and traceability in the supply chain, provides transaction records traceability, and enhances security for the whole supply chain. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based, fully decentralized traceability model that ensures the integrity and transparency of the system. This new model eliminated most of the disadvantages of the traditional supply chain. For the coordination of all transactions in the supply chain, we proposed a decentralized supply chain model along with a smart contract. © 2022 Ibtisam Ehsan et al.","Agriculture; Customer satisfaction; Decentralized systems; Digital storage; Food safety; Food supply; Quality assurance; Smart contract; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Transparency; Block-chain; Centralised; Conceptual model; Customer loyalty; Customers' satisfaction; Data storage; Food supply chain; Food-safety; Supply chain modeling; Supply chain systems; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

It is a hot topic in the field of machine learning, and HAR is gaining more attention among researchers due to its unique societal and economic advantages. This paper focuses on a collaborative computation scenario where a group of participants will securely and collaboratively train an accurate HAR model. The training process requires collecting a massive number of personal activity features and labels, which raises privacy problems. We decentralize the training process locally to each client in order to ensure the privacy of training data. Furthermore, we use an advanced secure aggregation algorithm to ensure that malicious participants cannot extract private information from the updated parameters even during the aggregation phase. Edge computing nodes have been introduced into our system to address the problem of data generation devices' insufficient computing power. We replace the traditional central server with smart contract to make the system more robust and secure. We achieve the verifiability of the packaged nodes using the publicly auditability feature of blockchain. According to the experimental data, the accuracy of the HAR model trained by our proposed framework reaches 93.24%, which meets the applicability requirements. The use of secure multiparty computation techniques unavoidably increases training time, and experimental results show that a round of iterations takes 36.4 seconds to execute, which is still acceptable. © 2022 Lin Wang et al.","Cognitive systems; Pattern recognition; Privacy-preserving techniques; Collaborative computation; Daily lives; Economic advantages; Hot topics; Human activity recognition; Privacy preserving; Privacy problems; Quality of life; Recognition models; Training process; Smart contract","C");

Additionally, blockchain technology and smart contracts have been characterised as a technological enabler for the energy sector and P2P Energy Markets (PEM). However, little research has been done to explore blockchain's user-centred perspective. Therefore, this paper analyses the reluctance and/or concerns of prosumers regarding smart contracts, and investigates their perception on blockchain within PEMs. The authors present the results of a survey conducted across several European countries addressing the implementation of automated trading systems and analysing the adoption of smart contracts. Considering that the main survey outcomes are related to the regulation and legislation uncertainty around blockchain usage, this paper explores also the fit of smart contracts from a legal perspective. Additionally, a set of recommendations to be used as the basis for the design and development of PEMs is delivered, aiming to adopt blockchain and smart contracts.

Bitcoin dominates the industry with the highest market share among the hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. However, high energy consumption leading to increasing carbon emission, prioritizing high-value transactions, and long waiting times are some of the flaws preventing it from reaching its full potential. Due to the block rewards getting halved every four years, miners and researchers are fearful that this would be the breaking point of Bitcoin's success. This paper proposes an industry 4.0 compliant next-generation Bitcoin architecture by introducing a dynamic and sustainable block concept. Along with our modified knapsack algorithm PBBK and APBBK, we can ensure a balanced transaction selection, quicker verification, higher transaction throughput, reduced carbon emission, and increased earnings for the miners. Moreover, with the addition of only one of our proposed sustainable blocks, we can cut down verification times by 50% and increase throughput by 39%. We can also reduce carbon emissions per transaction by 61.3%, which would help reduce Bitcoins' large carbon footprint, enabling us to approach greener digital transactions.

In this paper, a lightweight blockchain called LBlockchainE is designed for edge IoT-enabled MTS to guarantee the security of sensor data stored in an edge computing environment. To save the resources of edge servers on ship, a data placement strategy is proposed. To encourage edge servers to positively contribute to storing data generated by sensor devices, storage resource consumption is employed as an influencing parameter, and servers with abundant resources are selected for priority storage. The data placement strategy also takes care of the access delay between servers and selects the nodes with the least access and storage costs as the priority storage choice. LBlockchainE applies the low-energy-consumption characteristics of Proof of Stake to determine the ownership of bookkeeping rights through a small number of competitive calculations and the resources of the node. Experimental results indicate that compared with Ethereum, the consensus mechanism of LBlockchainE consumes less energy and occupies less storage space. On average, the new system uses 1.6&#x0025; less time and consumes 78&#x0025; less battery power compared with traditional blockchain systems.

After receiving task data, the BS allocates computational resources provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to help sensors perform tasks. Existing blockchain-based computation offloading schemes usually focus on network performance improvements, such as energy consumption minimization or latency minimization, and neglect the Gas fee for computation offloading, resulting in the dissatisfaction of high Gas providers. Also, the secrecy rate during the data uploading process can not be measured by a steady value because of the time-varying characteristics of IRS-based wireless channels, thereby computational resources allocation with a secrecy rate measured before data uploading is inappropriate. In this paper, we design a Gas-oriented computation offloading scheme that guarantees a low degree of dissatisfaction of sensors, while reducing energy consumption. Also, we deduce the ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-assisted PLS transmission that can represent the global secrecy performance to allocate computational resources. The simulations show that the proposed scheme has lower energy consumption compared to existing schemes, and ensures that the node paying higher Gas gets stronger computational resources.

For the efficient analysis, our application scenarios will be focused on the personalized healthcare supply chain system. For the theoretical basis novelty, we consider the two core aspects. (1) For the Multimedia System and Multimodal Sensing, they will undertake the role of interface optimization and the comprehensive data optimization and (2) for the Edge Computing and the Data Optimization. The data center will become an important foundation for the hospital to then achieve digital transformation. For the designed system, we use the Unique Device Identification (UDI) for the product tagging, the blockchain for the safety guarantee, and the Supply-Processing-Distribution (SPD) based model are considered. For the optimization of the performance, the Gale-Shapley model considering the complex network is designed. Through the comparison experiment, the proposed model is tested under different environment. It has been reflected that the proposed model is efficient and accurate. For testing the robustness of the model, the dynamic simulation is added. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Data optimization; Edge computing; Multimedia system; Multimodal sensing; Personalized healthcare; Supply chain system","C");

It has dual aims for overseas studying online platforms to increase competency and stimulate adoption of long-term overseas studying counseling, studying design, and overseas studying management for international students to enter the target university. It has generally achieved its first aim. Its issues are hindering the accomplishment of the second. Several solutions have been proposed to improve overseas studying procedures, yet none has considered the revolutionary advancement to prevent fraud and falsification issues. In this paper, we propose an online platform for studying in Korea with exploiting blockchain technology to provide trustworthy information. A key to this research's success is a scalable and distributed blockchain technology, which has been applied as a distributed transaction book and smart contract.

That’s when we can consider Machine Learning integrated with Blockchain to provide high security to build this model. Machine Learning and Blockchain are two very innovative domains of computing. There has been a constant improvement in neural networks in past years. Since Artificial Intelligence-based learning algorithms are taken into account and a drive towards the training of autonomous cars is seen. Here, we are going to train a single car with great precision and accuracy, and then this alone trained car will share the data with all the other cars in its network. Hence, all of them will be sharing a particular network and the data will be exchanged. Now, when it comes to the learning of cars, we will be creating a blockchain network that will connect every car for that particular company. In this way, while in a dynamic condition also, the cars will stay connected with each and every one and the data will be exchanged. So, the training will be done using Deep Neural Networks and since the data transfer and weights update requires high security, we will be using Blockchain. For example, if any car gets hit by an accident or due to any possible fatal breakdown or due to any changes in the route or signals (government laws), this data will be transmitted to each other car in this network. Hence every car will get its weight updated to avoid or tackle the situation. This in the end will decrease the computational time and increase the measure of safety and well-being. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Deep learning; Deep Neural Network; Ethereum; Image processing; Ledger; Machine learning; Solidity","非CCF推荐");

Health data are usually collected from edge-based Internet of medical things (IoMT) with devices such as smart wearable devices, smart watches, and smartphones. Since health data are highly private and have great financial value, adversaries ceaselessly launch diverse attacks to obtain private information. All these issues pose great challenges to health data sharing in edge-based IoMT scenarios. Existing research either lacks comprehensive consideration of privacy and security protection or fails to provide a proper incentive mechanism, which expels users from sharing data. In this study, we propose a novel blockchain-assisted data sharing scheme, which allows secure and privacy-preserving profile matching. A bloom filter with hash functions is designed to verify the authenticity of keyword ciphertext. Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) algorithm and smart contracts are employed to achieve secure profile matching. To incentivize users actively participating in profile matching, we devise an incentive mechanism and construct a two-phase Stackelberg game to address pricing problems for data owners and accessing problems of data requesters. The optimal pricing mechanism is specially designed for encouraging more users to participate in health data sharing and maximizing users’ profit. Moreover, security analysis illustrates that the proposed protocol is capable of satisfying various security goals, while performance evaluation shows high scalability and feasibility of the proposed scheme in edge-based IoMT scenarios.

Therefore, the detection of forged facial videos has become critical to internet content regulation. In this paper, a deep forgery face video detection method with fusion of frequency domain features and spatial domain features (FFS) is proposed to address the problem of deepfake face video detection. At first, the proposed method extracts the wavelet features of images with two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform, then extracts the multidimensional wavelet feature vectors of images according to n-level wavelet decomposition. The frequency domain features of the image extracted by the discrete Fourier transform are also cascaded and fused with the wavelet features. Besides, the proposed method can better address the overfitting problem of detection methods in practical internet application scenarios by establishing a shared updatable strategy. Finally, in order to improve the generalization ability of the detection model and address the problem that the model is vulnerable to malicious attacks under the above shared update strategy, blockchain technology is employed to implement an incentive mechanism. It can motivate participants to provide real and health data, and then achieve the establishment and maintenance of a good shared and renewable environment. Moreover, we use DeepfakeDetection and Celeb-DF datasets to conduct the experiments. Samples with different percentages of high-quality images are selected to simulate the complex environment of image quality in the Internet.

Such a service aims to support safe navigation while optimizing ships' trajectories. However, to deploy it, timely and accurate prediction of ships' positioning with real-time reactions is needed to anticipate collisions. In such a context, ships positions are usually predicted using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Traditionally, ML schemes require that the data be processed in a centralized way, e.g., a cloud data center managed by a third party. However, these schemes are not suitable for the collisions avoidance service due to the inaccessibility of ships' positioning data by this third party, and allowing connected ships to get access to sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new cooperative collision avoidance system for inland ships, while ensuring data security and privacy. Our system is based on deep federated learning to collaboratively build a model of ship positioning prediction, while avoiding sharing their private data. In addition, it is deployed at multi-access edge computing (MEC) level to provide low-latency communication to ensure fast responses during collision detection. Furthermore, it relies on Blockchain and smart contracts to ensure trust and valid communications between ships and MEC nodes. We evaluate the proposed system using a generated dataset representing ships mobility in France. The results, which demonstrate the accuracy of our prediction model, prove the effectiveness of our cooperative collision avoidance system in ensuring timely and reliable communications and avoiding collisions between ships.

Despite the growing use of electronic health records (EHRs) by medical practitioners and wearable digital gadgets by individuals, 80% of health and medical data remain unused, adding little value to the work of researchers and medical practitioners. Legislative constraints related to health data sharing, centralized siloed design of traditional data management systems, and most importantly, lack of incentivization models are thought to be the underpinning bottlenecks for sharing health data. With the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) and the development of technologies like blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), it is now possible to create a new paradigm of data sharing by changing the incentivization model from current authoritative or altruistic form to a shared economic model where financial incentivization will be the main driver for data sharing. This can be achieved by setting up a digital health data marketplace (DHDM). Here, we review papers that proposed technical models or implemented frameworks that use blockchain-like technologies for health data. We seek to understand and compare different technical challenges associated with implementing and optimizing the DHDM operation outlined in these articles. We also examine legal limitations in the context of the EU and other countries such as the USA to accommodate any compliance requirement for such a marketplace.

Therefore, data are shared resources and crucial in urban computing. In particular, group communication is essential for effective data sharing and to updating software in an IoT system. However, changing the group key is imperative for data security in group communication whenever the group member changes. When the movement of IoTs is high, group key redistribution must be repeated because the group membership keeps changing. In changing and redistributing the group keys, overhead occurs, inevitably degrading system performance. In addition, since much data traffic generates in IoT devices&#x2019; crowded areas, transmission delay and data loss could degrade system performance. Due to IoT&#x2019;s low power and low capacity characteristics, one-to-one communication is inefficient, requiring efficient group management and group key management. This work proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based group and group key management scheme to establish an efficient communication environment in urban computing. We adopted blockchains to track the movement and density of IoT and secure node authorization. Using the upper layer blockchain, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) determines the movement and density of IoTs. Using the lower-layer blockchain, base stations (BSs) identify the IoT&#x2019;s movement of information in each group. We included only nodes determined to be safe in the group. Through the hierarchical blockchain, while protecting the IoT&#x2019;s privacy, we can record the information in the blockchain to determine the mobility of nodes and the node density of a group. We set several experimental environments, and analyzed the efficiency by simulating the addition of secondary gateways and group integration. As a result, we showed that our proposal establishes an efficient communication environment and reduces computational and communication overhead.

The traditional host-centric network can no longer meet the needs of the IoT for throughput, privacy protection and interrupt tolerance. IC-IoT, the combination of ICN (Information Centric Networking) and IoT was put forward, which could provide scalable content distribution by using caching-router, multi-party communication, and the decoupling between senders and receivers. However, this paradigm still faces two major problems. First, the access control relationship established between publishers and subscribers requires additional maintenance of complex data structure and authentication process. Second, unencrypted named-data objects (NDO) lead to potential risks of privacy protection. To address those challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called ZK-CP-ABE as an encryption means for distributed content distribution. Based on CP-ABE, it introduces the non-interactive zero knowledge proof protocol into the CP-ABE’s secret-key existence proof to ensure user privacy and reduce invalid bandwidth consumption. On this basis, a system called DPS-IoT is proposed, which uses Hyperledger Fabric based blockchain system to store access policies and evidence for ZKP to prevent them from being tampered with. In addition, we use smart contract to implement ZK-CP-ABE based access control, so as to improve the robustness and throughput of the system. Finally, by comparing with the existing related works, it is proved that the method and system proposed in this paper have greater advantages in utilization of transmission bandwidth, and better performance in system throughput. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; CP-ABE; ICN; IoT; ZKP5G mobile communication systems; Access control; Bandwidth; Blockchain; Cryptography; Distributed ledger; Smart contract; Block-chain; Communicationtechnology; Content distribution; Core business; CP-ABE; Information-centric; Information-centric networkings; Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs; Privacy protection; ZKP; Internet of things","非CCF推荐");

However, existing centralized schemes inevitably suffer from the limitations of a single point of failure, low reliability, and poor scalability. In addition, the management and maintenance of attributes in CP-ABE solutions often require higher costs.

Concerns over the ease of transmission of the infection led to the imposition of measures restricting freedom such as curfews, lockdown, general confinement, and closure of trade. Technology was one of the tools used to resist to the spread of the disease using applications that, on one hand, track contacts to warn users that were close to someone infected and, on the other hand, provide immunity digital certification. Despite the relevance of these options, end users have no confidence, transparency, and responsibility that the registration and use of their health data are ethical, secure, anonymous, and available through verifiable credentials and, most importantly, is being used for its main purpose. Consequently, a solution based on a distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, is introduced to assure the trustworthiness and integrity of user’s data. Since the proposed application embraced user privacy, we conducted a comparative study between permissioned blockchains, that includes an authorization abstraction layer and ensures that certain actions can only be performed by identifiable participants. We concluded that Hyperledger Fabric was an option that fulfilled all the requirements to develop a platform for the immunity passport ledger.

The pseudonym mechanism and the confusion mechanism between identity and message protect the privacy of vehicle users’ identities. The information on the blockchain must pass reasonable judgment algorithms and meet the conditions for ending of the event.

Smart-contract platforms like Ethereum are a popular choice for developers of blockchain games. However, due to their architecture they are unsuitable for complex on-chain computations, as those would lead to unfeasibly high gas costs. Consequently, most blockchain games today are either trivial in terms of game mechanics or run on a centralised server, defeating the original purpose of using a blockchain. In this paper, we present an alternate architecture based on game-state processors (GSPs). This model decouples computations from the core blockchain layer (miners and full nodes), effectively sharding computation and storage of state between the different applications and games. With this, a blockchain platform can be scaled horizontally to support many and highly-complex games with fully decentralised, on-chain computations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain gaming; Decentralised gaming; Game-state processor; Play-to-earn; Scalability","非CCF推荐");

In this chapter, I use the example of the best known blockchain-based game CryptoKitties (2017) to explore the idea of a ‘fair price’ both in theory and in practice, and to connect it to the concept of fairness in games. I turn to the essential works on fairness and cheating in game studies and check whether game ethics is applicable to so-called ‘money games’ on blockchain. Theoretically, decentralization of blockchain technology supports the idea of fairness; however, in practice, the game follows the same grey moral code as the preceding online games and virtual worlds. I suggest that the applicable understanding of fairness can be found in the ‘code is law’ principle that underlines both normative game studies and the ideology of blockchain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Blockchain games; Fairness; Technology ethics; Virtual economies","非CCF推荐");

However, the scale of NFT content data is so huge that we have to use P2P storage network to store it.

Besides if an accident occurs on the blockchain or storage network that is different from the expectation, such as fork, the data state on-chain and off-chain would may be inconsistent. Therefore, we propose the concept of State for P2P storage network to represent the resource allocation of data and assist in the off-line retrieval of resources.

It gives people a secure and anonymous channel for verifying content’s reliability and further limiting the reckless sharing and spreading of news content by people. Inherited properties of blockchain by the platform, i.e., immutability and traceability, combat the spread of fake news. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Decentralized; Fake news detection; ImmutabilityFake detection; Block-chain; Decentralised; Fake news detection; Immutability; Major events; News content; Presenting informations; Public opinions; Social media; Viral spread; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

A VPDC is an extension of a commitment along with an accompanying proof, convincing a verifier that (i) the given commitment is well-formed and (ii) a certain part of the committed message can be decrypted using a (secret) trapdoor known to a trusted party. We first formalize VPDCs and then introduce a general decryption feasibility result that overcomes the challenges in relaxed proofs arising in the lattice setting. Our general result can be applied to a wide class of Fiat-Shamir based protocols and may be of independent interest. Next, we show how to extend the commonly used lattice-based ‘Hashed-Message Commitment’ (HMC) scheme into a succinct and efficient VPDC. In particular, we devise a novel ‘gadget’-based Regev-style (partial) decryption method, compatible with efficient relaxed lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs. We prove the soundness of our VPDC in the setting of adversarial proofs, where a prover tries to create a valid VPDC output that fails in decryption. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our results, we extend a private blockchain payment protocol, MatRiCT, by Esgin et al. (ACM CCS ’19) into a formally auditable construction, which we call MatRiCT-Au, with very low communication and computation overheads over MatRiCT. © 2022, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Accountable Ring Signature; Auditable RingCT; Lattice; Verifiable Partially-Decryptable Commitment; Zero KnowledgeAuthentication; Computation theory; Privacy-preserving techniques; Accountable ring signature; Auditable ringct; Building blockes; Lattice; Lattice-based; Privacy-preserving protocols; Ring signatures; Trusted party; Verifiable partially-decryptable commitment; Zero knowledge; Historic preservation","非CCF推荐");

Asharov and Orlandi (ASIACRYPT’12) extend covert security to enable parties to create publicly verifiable evidence about misbehavior that can be transferred to any third party. This notion is called publicly verifiable covert security (PVC) and has been investigated by multiple works. While these two notions work well in settings with known identities in which parties care about their reputation, they fall short in Internet-like settings where there are only digital identities that can provide some form of anonymity. In this work, we propose the notion of financially backed covert security (FBC), which ensures that the adversary is financially punished if cheating is detected. Next, we present three transformations that turn PVC protocols into FBC protocols. Our protocols provide highly efficient judging, thereby enabling practical judge implementations via smart contracts deployed on a blockchain. In particular, the judge only needs to non-interactively validate a single protocol message while previous PVC protocols required the judge to emulate the whole protocol. Furthermore, by allowing an interactive punishment procedure, we can reduce the amount of validation to a single program instruction, e.g., a gate in a circuit. An interactive punishment, additionally, enables us to create financially backed covert secure protocols without any form of common public transcript, a property that has not been achieved by prior PVC protocols. © 2022, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Covert Security; Financial Punishment; Multi-Party Computation (MPC); Public VerifiabilityComputation theory; Cryptography; Covert security; Financial punishment; Misbehaviour; Multi-party computation; Multiparty computation; Public verifiability; Publicly verifiable; Security notion; Security protocols; Third parties; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

First, we use the zero-knowledge proof algorithm to make the scheme independent of the trusted third party and realise secure data exchange between the device and the agent server (AS). The AS verifies the identity of the device through the proof that does not contain any private user information that can be reconstructed, which plays an effective role in protecting the privacy of the device. Second, the device submits the proof, which is generated from private device information and public parameter information. It has nothing to do with the trust domain authentication mechanism. Therefore, it can be used for mutual authentication between heterogeneous domains. Finally, we use the characteristics of decentralisation and tamper proof of blockchain technology to ensure the consistency of interdomain message storage and realise cross-domain authentication.

The traditional digital rights protection scheme is inefficient, highly centralized, and has the risk of being tampered with. At the same time, blockchain cannot save all original files of digital resources due to its storage size limitation. Firstly, this paper proposes a dynamic limb action recognition algorithm based on dance pose prediction (RADPP). This algorithm recognizes the dance action in dance short video based on deep learning. The algorithm extracts the features of dance action accurately and forms a log file that can represent the short dance video. The algorithm stores the dance pose file into the blockchain to the purpose of preservation. On the one hand, the above methods improve the efficiency of short dance video storage, reduce the degree of centralization of storage, and eliminate the risk of copyright information being easily tampered with; at the same time, the log file calculated by deep learning technology for short video not only ensures the privacy of copyright information, but also ensures the feasibility of storing video information into blockchain.

The drawbacks for the centralized exchange of cross-chain assets in the participating blockchains are overcome by our decentralized SEPoW. To reduce the size of a cross-chain proof, we introduce merged mining into our SEPoW such that the proof consists of two Merkle tree paths regardless of the size of the current blockchain. We prove that the proposed SEPoW achieves the desirable security properties that a secure sidechains construction should have. As an exemplary concrete instantiation we propose SEPoW for a PoW blockchain system consistent with Bitcoin. We evaluate the size of SEPoW proof and compare it with the state-of-the-art PoW sidechains protocols.

The protocol must not only satisfy confidentiality and security but also provide anonymity and untraceability for sensor nodes. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an authentication and key agreement protocol for sensors and servers based on blockchain technology in the wireless body area network, with the help of session keys for subsequent access and data transmission.

The emergence of electricity-based utilities such as electric vehicles, electric-based cooking utensils, and increased electrified train systems has given birth to smart grid (SG). Moreover, the cost of the traditional power hyphen-based system comes at very high price for the consumers. There are also various security flaws in traditional SG system. The SG is based on a centralized system, which again makes them prone to many attacks. Also, it fails when renewable energy source comes into the picture. This paper deeply analyzes the infrastructure, weakness in managing power distribution, and security flaws in the SG. The paper also covers the vital solutions taking both preventive and curative measures for the security issues in SG.

They depend on the generation and sharing of data between vehicles to improve safety and efficiency of the transportation system. However, due to the open nature of the vehicle network, dishonest and misbehaving vehicles may exist in the vehicular network. Misbehavior detection has been studied using machine learning in recent years. Existing misbehavior detection approaches require network equipment with powerful computing capabilities to constantly train and update sophisticated network models, which reduces the efficiency of the misbehavior detection system due to limited resources and untimely model updates. In this paper, we propose a new federated learning scheme based on blockchain, which can reduce resource utilization while ensuring data security and privacy.

Nevertheless, the traditional solutions for energy trading usually rely on a centralized framework, which is vulnerable to high operation cost and low transparency. To address the problem, the blockchain strategy has been widely deployed in microgrid energy trading. However, existing blockchain-based systems have not formally considered: (i) collusion attacks launched by a pair of dishonest consumer and microgrid; (ii) and the demands of maximizing bilateral utility. Therefore, in this work, we propose a blockchain-based microgrid energy trading system that allows a consumer to dynamically change its service quality quotes for a microgrid. In particular, bilateral utility of requester-provider is almost maximized, with employing a Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategy to model the interaction between consumers and microgrids. Moreover, collusion attacks during the bidding process are certainly prevented from a dishonest pair of consumer and microgrid. To achieve this, we employ a request-based comparable encryption technique to compare two microgrids’ revenues in a privacy-preserving way, in which each microgrid should submit an encrypted expected revenue. In addition, a general security analysis of our system is formally discussed. To illustrate the effectiveness, we take a blockchain-based framework to build the experiment platform, where the structure of nodes and transaction process are well formalized. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bilateral utility; Blockchain; Collision resistance; Energy trading; MicrogridBlockchain; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Bilateral utility; Block-chain; Collision resistance; Collusion attack; Distributed energies; Energy internet; Energy trading; Future energies; Microgrid; Utility maximizations; Power markets","非CCF推荐");

With no treatment or vaccine available at the time, it was necessary to rely on non-pharmaceutical methods for case identification and contact tracing. This kind of approach has good results in detecting and preventing tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Contact tracing and keeping safe distances are crucial to containing the spread of COVID-19. Nonetheless, contact tracing is a complex intervention, it involves quarantining and investigating close contacts. Manual contact tracing methods are slow, require a large amount of effort, and more often than not rely on the memory or assumptions of individuals. To combat these downsides, contact tracing applications were developed, resulting in quicker and more reliable recognition of infected individuals. However, because of the complex nature of these applications and their lack of transparency, a large portion of the population started doubting the privacy of the data collected. Soon after, many of these applications started to dwindle in the user department, which caused a feedback loop. “If fewer people are using the application, the application itself becomes useless, and there is no longer a reason to use it.” Is clear that the main issue behind their downfall was an overwhelming lack of trust. In response, this paper will analyze how the use of blockchain technology can help the development of a more transparent application. And describe how a proof of work based on this concept was implemented. On the same note, it will also approach why was Hyperledger Sawtooth chosen, instead of more popular solutions such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Bluetooth; Contact tracing; COVID-19; Directed acyclic graph; Distributed ledger; Ethereum; Hyperledger; Hyperledger sawtooth","非CCF推荐");

The existing certificate revocation schemes generally suffer from a time-consuming process of certificate status verification as well as a long interval of revocation information updating. To address aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based certificate revocation mechanism, namely CRchain, which can efficiently check certificate status and revoke the certificate. Specifically, to achieve efficient certificate status queries, revokedCertCF and validCertCF cuckoo filters are constructed for storing the revoked and valid certificates, respectively. And then, the co-controlled key published on CRchain is presented for shortening the certificate revocation process and abridging the authority of certificate authorities. Finally, we implement and evaluate CRchain on Hyperledger Fabric with smart contract.

However, traditional secret sharing schemes are often insufficient, especially for applications in which the set of parties who hold the secret shares might change over time. To achieve security in this setting, dynamic proactive secret sharing (DPSS) is used. DPSS schemes proactively update the secret shares held by the parties and allow changes to the set of parties holding the secrets. We propose FaB-DPSS (FAst Batched DPSS) – a new and highly optimized batched DPSS scheme. While previous work on batched DPSS [BDLO15] focuses on a single client submitting a batch of secrets and does not allow storing and releasing secrets independently, we allow multiple different clients to dynamically share and release secrets. FaB-DPSS is the most efficient robust DPSS scheme that supports the highest possible adversarial threshold of 12. We prove FaB-DPSS secure and implement it. All operations complete in seconds, and we outperform a prior state-of-the-art DPSS scheme [MZW+19] by over 6 ×. Additionally, we propose new applications of DPSS in the context of blockchains. Specifically, we propose a protocol that uses blockchains and FaB-DPSS to provide conditional secret storage. The protocol allows parties to store secrets along with a release condition, and once a (possibly different) party satisfies this release condition, the secret is privately released to that party. This functionality is similar to extractable witness encryption. While there are numerous compelling applications (e.g., time-lock encryption, one-time programs, and fair multi-party computation) which rely on extractable witness encryption, there are no known efficient constructions (or even constructions based on any well-studied assumptions) of extractable witness encryption. However, by utilizing blockchains and FaB-DPSS, we can easily build all those applications. We provide an implementation of our conditional secret storage protocol as well as several applications building on top of it. © 2022, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Application programs; Computation theory; Cryptography; Block-chain; Change-over time; Condition; Extractables; In-control; Learn+; Proactive secret sharing; Proactive Secret Sharing Schemes; Secret sharing schemes; State of the art; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Our study addresses the problem by creating smart legal contract markup language (SLCML), an XML-based smart-contract language with pattern and transformation rules that automatically convert XML code to the Solidity language. In particular, we develop an XML schema (SLCML schema) that is used to instantiate any type of business contract understandable to IT and non-IT practitioners and is processed by computers.

A few existing ETC systems suffer from various unexpected activities such as data security, transparency of the stored data, the privacy of users, and data immutability as these systems perform in a centralized platform. Blockchain is a secure technology for its nascent features such as decentralization, transparency, and data security. In this paper, a Blockchain-based Automated Toll-Tax Collection System (BATCS) has been proposed. The proposed system can collect an appropriate TA without stopping the vehicle while it passes the toll plaza.

The next technology is called blockchain, which establishes the P2P (peer-to-peer) network, decentralized and non-tampering technique exists.

However, patients’ EMRs are usually distributed in the databases of multiple medical institutions. Due to the insecurity of the network environment and distrust of other parties, EMR owners worry about data insecurity and privacy leakage, which makes sharing with other parties difficult. Patients worry about the loose control of their health data as well. To solve this problem, we present a solution for the EMRs data sharing based on blockchain and federated learning, which will provide data security and patients’ privacy. Firstly, we propose a method for EMRs data retrieval records and sharing records as transaction records adding to the blockchain, and design the two algorithm processes, respectively. Secondly, federated learning is used to help EMRs data owners to build a model based on the original data. The data owner only shares the model instead of the original data. Finally, by security and privacy analytics, we analyzed the advantages and influence of the proposed model. Overall, the evaluation shows that the proposed solution is significantly superior to the previous models and achieves reasonable efficiency for sharing EMRs data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Electronic medical records; Federated learning; Privacy; Security sharingData privacy; Diagnosis; E-learning; Medical computing; Records management; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Federated learning; Health data; Medical institutions; Network environments; Privacy; Privacy leakages; Security and privacy; Security sharing; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

The proposed scheme make use of decoupled blockchain architecture to overcome the limited resources capabilities of drones to perform blockchain-based computations.

However, with the spirit of full transparency, many public blockchains expose all types of data to the public such as Ethereum. Besides, the on-chain persistence of large data is significantly expensive technically and economically. These issues lead to the difficulty of sharing fairly large private data while preserving attractive properties of public blockchains. Although direct encryption for on-chain data persistence can introduce confidentiality, new challenges such as key sharing, access control, and legal rights proving are still open. Meanwhile, cross-chain collaboration still requires secure and effective protocols, though decentralized storage systems such as IPFS bring the possibility for fairly large data persistence. In this paper, we propose Sunspot, a decentralized framework for privacy-preserving data sharing with access control on transparent public blockchains, to solve these issues. We also show the practicality and applicability of Sunspot by MyPub, a decentralized privacy-preserving publishing platform based on Sunspot.

The currently known blockchain range proof scheme is unable to process floating-point numbers, which limits the application fields of range proof.

As a promising networking paradigm, software-defined networking (SDN) makes IoT more flexible and agile by decoupling control plane from data plane. With a large number of heterogeneous devices accessing to the network, we need to divide the network into several domains and each domain is managed by an SDN controller. Controllers share topologies with each other to form global view of the entire network, which is used for crossing-domain path routing. However, crossing-domain routing requires global trust between multiple controllers. The reason is that if the malicious controller shares misleading topologies, the rest of controllers may calculate mistaken crossing-domain paths. As a result, packets are forwarded to the domain that is managed by the malicious controller and dropped deliberately, which is known as the black-hole attack. To this end, we present a blockchain-based architecture to ensure secure routing among multiple domains in SDN-enabled IoT networks. All SDN controllers are equipped with blockchains, and they upload abstract topologies to the blockchain via the smart contract. Thus, the genuine view of the entire network can be gained from the blockchain due to its consensus and immutability. In addition, we use the concept of reputation that consists of the local reputation and the global reputation to further protect routing reliability, and the global reputation is reserved in the blockchain. Compared with benchmark architectures, the emulation results show that our proposed method can effectively build trust between multiple controllers and ensure secure routing among multiple domains. © 2022 Zhihao Zeng et al.","5G mobile communication systems; Internet of things; Network architecture; Network routing; Network security; Topology; Block-chain; Control planes; Data planes; Decoupling controls; Mobile communication technology; Multi-domains; Multiple controllers; Multiple domains; Secure routing; Software-defined networkings; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

In addition, the proposed scheme uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store the oceans of medical privacy data, and encrypts the hash index to store, which improves the efficiency of data sharing.

An implementation of this idea is called blockchain, which is a distributed protocol that allows the creation of an immutable ledger. While such an idea is very appealing, the ledger may be contaminated with incorrect, illegal, or even dangerous data, and everyone running the blockchain protocol has no option but to store and propagate the unwanted data. The ledger is bloated over time, and it is not possible to remove redundant information. Finally, missing data cannot be inserted later. Redactable blockchains were invented to allow the ledger to be mutated in a controlled manner. To date, redactable blockchains support at most two types of redactions: block modification and removal. The next logical step is to support block insertions. However, we show that this seemingly innocuous enhancement renders all previous constructs insecure.

While cryptocurrency is growing rapidly, potential risks are simultaneously emerging. Users thus may abandon their usage behavior of cryptocurrency, hindering the future development of cryptocurrency. While prior studies focus more on the intention to use cryptocurrency in the pre-adoption phase, less studies pay attention to discontinuance usage intention in the post-adoption phase. To fill this knowledge gap, this stfudy aims to explore factors that cause discontinuance usage intention regarding cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the net valence framework theoretically grounded on the theory of reason action, a dilemmatic dual-factor model is proposed to figure out cryptocurrency users' discontinuance usage intention from the perceived risk and perceived benefit. This study identifies four potential risks and three potential benefits that affect perceived risk and benefit. The model with nine hypotheses were developed, and research data were collected by a survey method. A total of 343 valid responses were received, and PLS-SEM with SmartPLS was utilized to test the nine hypotheses, with seven hypotheses supported empirically. Findings: Our findings demonstrate that financial, legal and operational risks are critical to increase users' perceived risk, and perceived usefulness and seamless transactions play important roles in enhancing users' perceived benefit. Moreover, while perceived risk can increase users' discontinuance usage intention to cryptocurrency, perceived benefit can mitigate such intention. Originality/value: This study contributes nascent knowledge to the literature by examining factors that influence discontinuous usage intention in regard to cryptocurrencies, to firms that have issued or attempted to issue cryptocurrencies and to the potential users of cryptocurrencies by adjusting the mode of operation and investment strategies and reducing user costs, achieving a win-win situation for firms and users. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cryptocurrency; Discontinuance usage; Perceived benefit; Perceived risk; Post-adoption behavior","非CCF推荐");

Most IoT deployments employ cost-efficient lightweight devices with limited resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, storage). Although an IoT network must be built in its simplest form, engineers include more sophisticated devices like gateways and servers to provide web-based services and benefit from cloud systems. So, although the nodes can be widely distributed geographically or topologically, the system becomes centralized, which causes bottlenecks and single-points-of-failure. Furthermore, providing data integrity, nonrepudiation, and event management becomes tricky. In most IoT scenarios, data usually flow from sensors to storage and processing units, whereas event-driven commands and triggers flow from these units to actuators, if any. Therefore, an attacker who gained access to parts of the centralized systems may leak, alter, or remove critical data and may exploit event handling features. This is where blockchain technology can be extremely useful. Using a decentralized ledger as the data storage unit provides integrity, immutability, and nonrepudiation for any IoT deployment. And a customized smart contract lets the IoT deployment benefit from decentralized and immutable (i.e. nonmanipulatable) event management features, too. Further, decentralization provides resilience against availability attacks to a large extent. With this motivation, we introduced a novel IoT architecture that incorporates an Ethereum-based private (Quorum) blockchain running a unique ad-hoc smart contract and a message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) based communication scheme between sensor and actuator nodes. The scheme, the ledger, and the smart contract have also been implemented with several nodes, a broker, and a server all on a PC using Docker containers, where the server was running a forest fire risk detection algorithm as the use case scenario. The proof-of-concept successfully validates the abovesaid functionality, scalability, and efficiency for the given IoT scenario (and some others). Moreover, performance tests showed that an instance of the system with 1000 nodes could stably process and record incoming (sensor) data up to 12.5 transactions per second (TPS) and distribute commands up to 4 TPS, whereas higher TPS is achievable depending on the network conditions and tolerance to losses.

This paper introduces a generic architecture design that incorporates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to establish trust of BIoT services. This can potentially solve the trust problem and based on our experiment it can be scaled well. We also demonstrate how specification languages can be useful to express requirements. It decouples users from Blockchain and thus they can specify qualities of BIoT services without deep knowledge to work with Blockchain. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Blockchain technology (BCT); Blockchain-based Internet of Things (BIoT); public key infrastructure (PKI); service; specification language; trustBlockchain; Internet of things; Specification languages; Specifications; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Blockchain-based internet of thing; Hardware/software; Public key infrastructure; Service; Software infrastructure; Trust; Public key cryptography","非CCF推荐");

Also, the performance, scalability, and sustainability of the decentralized systems are not taken into account. One of the reasons is the time-consuming testing process. The other is the hardware requirements and the complexity of the software installations of the testing environment. Developer communities need stable and secure research networks to test and develop prototypes before releasing the working versions. Cloud-based blockchain test networks are available, but it allows using a specific framework. Also, users are required to learn how to use each framework. Blockchain test networks use public ledgers, and this is also not preferable in many project implementations because of privacy reasons. Testbeds are inflexible and unrealistic in terms of scalability and performance. There is a need for a physical test network to create a realistic test environment. This study aims to form a sustainable and scalable research environment where decentralized technologies are researched and developed. The method of this study will include three stages to create a decentralized research network. The first stage is to develop the decentralized foundation of the network by using the Quorum blockchain framework and RAFT consensus protocol. Node requirements are simplified to run on low-cost devices. The second stage will be to develop a web-based platform to serve as an efficient way for the developers to deploy smart contracts easily. The final stage will be ensuring the sustainability of the system. Usage policy is formed that includes management of the network, the system usage rules, and regulations. A decentralized governance model is proposed. Smart contracts are developed to manage and ensure the sustainability of the research network. The available test tools were not sufficient and not flexible to use in this system, so a new test tool was developed for this project. The new test tool will verify the research environment with scalability, latency, and performance tests. As a result, the “Decentralized Solutions for Humanity” (DS4H) research network is deployed in four different regions of Turkey. This network is tested with four initial nodes. New nodes are to be added worldwide. The developed tools named Chainex, GoHammer, and Scanner are shared as open-source. Future works will include adding multiple blockchain network support, working on consensus protocols and new decentralized services. Finally, the DS4H research network provides a test and development research environment for blockchain projects with sustainable and low-cost maintenance. © 2022 Turkiye Klinikleri.

Block generation constitutes the basis of this technology, and the optimization of such systems is among the most crucial concerns. Determining either the block size or the number of transactions in the block brings out a remarkable problem that has been solved by the miners in recent years. First, higher block size results in higher transaction time, on the other hand, smaller block size has many disadvantages such as security, lower transaction fees, lower transaction numbers in a given time interval, which makes it unable to compete with other currency systems due to this bulky structure and higher block generation time. In this study, multiobjective optimization problem (OP) is proposed by minimizing block generation and transmission time. This multiobjective OP is transformed into a single OP by applying weighted sum method. To determine the optimal block size, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and whale optimization evolutionary algorithm (WOA) are employed. Although both algorithms have capability to reach optimum block size and corresponding time, WOA achieves better performance than PSO in terms of the convergence speed and output fluctuation. Moreover, analysis of the prediction of optimum block size is carried out under different weights which creates many optimization functions. Experimental results indicate that if higher weight is assigned to the transmission time, then block size decreases sharply. Furthermore, the experimental results reveal that design of the blockchain network and number of nodes in network profoundly affect the block size selection due to the time constraints. © 2022 Turkiye Klinikleri.

Traditional relay node selection techniques undergo collusion attacks, increased energy consumption, delay, and reduced network lifetime. To cope with these problems, we propose a Quantum Atom Search Optimization coupled with Blockchain aided Data Transmission (QASO-BDT) scheme for a relay node selection with security aided data transmission. This approach comprises three phases such as registration, clustering, and transmission. Initially, in the node registration phase every sensor node gets registered in the blockchain network through Capillary Gateway (CG). Next, in the clustering phase, a CH is selected and an enhanced multi-view clustering model is used to cluster the nodes into several clusters. Finally, the multi-hop transmission phase assists in best relay node selection for multi-hop transmission using QASO, and the blockchain-based transaction is carried out to ensure security in the system. The proposed scheme is simulated in the MATLAB platform and achieves a result of 91.5% throughput, the reduced energy value of 40%, end to end delay of 20.6%, and the exhaustion of node is 1% which results in an increased lifetime of the nodes.

This construction aggregates the public keys and provides a compact signature that is verified as a group, which realizes faster batch verification than confirming them individually. Furthermore, both the multisignature scale and the public key length are independent of the number of signers and attributes in this scheme.

However, this property impedes the development of blockchain because of the abuse of blockchain storage and legal obligations. To mitigate this issue, a novel construction of blockchain, called redactable blockchain, was introduced. It enables a central authority to issue the rewriting privilege to a particular party who can rewrite a registered object, e.g., a block or a transaction, in a controlled way. Unfortunately, the central authority must be fully trusted and is an obvious target suffering from various attacks. In this paper, we introduce a redactable blockchain controlled at a fine-grained level in a decentralized setting. In our solution, the rewriting privilege is issued by multiple authorities for reducing the vulnerability of the centralized setting. To formalize our solution, we introduce a novel cryptographic notion, called decentralized policy-based chameleon hash (DPCH), with the formal definition and security model. By applying several simple cryptographic tools, such as chameleon hash, digital signature, and multi-authority attribute-based encryption, we present the generic construction of DPCH along with rigorous security proofs. By applying RSA-based chameleon hash and BLS short signature, we give a practical instantiation of DPCH with performance evaluation. The comprehensive evaluation shows that our solution has superior performance than the state-of-the-art solution.

However, centralized SAGI-VCS is usually vulnerable to malicious attacks and the trust issues are one of the main reasons that hinder its further development. Blockchain as a distributed hyperledger shows a vital potential to solve the trust problem of multiple participants who do not trust each other and tackle the security issues in SAGI-VCS. Additionally, selfishness is another factor that prevents vehicles from participating in SAGI-VCS. The vast majority of existing incentives for vehicular crowdsensing only focus on the terrestrial networks which cannot be directly used in SAGI-VCS. Meanwhile, the redundant winner phenomenon and the multi-attributes of participants are less considered by them. Toward this end, we first illustrate a blockchain-enabled service architecture for SAGI-VCS and then construct a unified representation model. Afterwards, a tensor computing based truthful incentive mechanism TensorBC for blockchain-enabled SAGI-VCS is proposed to motivate vehicles to participate in completing tasks, ensure the security of the whole process and maximize the social welfare. TensorBC not only can eliminate the redundant winner phenomenon, but also can guarantee the economic properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality and profitability.

Diverse malicious network attacks are ubiquitous, along with the worldwide implementation of the Internet of Vehicles, which exposes a range of reliability and privacy threats for managing data in CAV networks. Combined with the fact that the capability of existing CAVs in handling intensive computation tasks is limited, this implies a need for designing an efficient assessment system to guarantee autonomous driving safety without compromising data security. In this article we propose a novel framework, namely Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving assessmenT (BEST), which offers a smart and reliable approach for conducting safe driving supervision while protecting vehicular information. Specifically, a promising solution that exploits a long short-term memory model is introduced to assess the safety level of the moving CAVs. Then we investigate how a distributed blockchain obtains adequate trustworthiness and robustness for CAV data by adopting a byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that our presented BEST gains better data credibility with a higher prediction accuracy for vehicular safety assessment when compared with existing schemes.

Different kinds of UxV (unmanned aerial vehicles, automated guided vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, etc.) are utilized to establish an automated garbage management scheme to collect and place the garbage both from the ground and sea surfaces. However, due to the limited battery capacity and inadequate resources of different UxV, a lightweight DL model is developed to detect the garbage successfully with a higher accuracy rate. The proposed lightweight DL model uses two activation functions named MISH and rectified linear unit to enhance the feature extraction and detect the garbage. Moreover, a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server is allocated in the proposed scheme to improve the quality of service (QoS) (i.e., reduce latency and improve security). Furthermore, a blockchain-based secure hazardous garbage (e.g., infectious, toxic, or radioactive materials) tracking technique is concluded in this scheme to identify the individual and reduce the potential harm to the environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the UxV can successfully detect the garbage using the proposed lightweight DL model within a minimum time frame and the obtained accuracy is higher than the other existing DL models.

Existing works dedicate to designing high-throughput payment channel networks (PCNs) or efficient PCN routing policies to reduce the transaction fee. In this paper, we design new mechanisms to reduce the routing fee through reordering the processing sequence of transactions. We present two mechanisms, one is periodic transaction processing and the other is strategic waiting. In the former, the incoming transactions in a short time interval are processed collectively. We model to minimize their total routing fee and derive the optimal permutation and routing policy of processing transactions. The benefit is redistributed efficiently and fairly through a Shapley-value based scheme. In the latter, we model the waiting time of a strategic transaction on a single channel as the first passage time problem in queuing theory when the channel balance is insufficient upon its arrival. We can calculate the waiting time distribution that is useful to gauge a user's cost of patience. Experimental results manifest that our cost redistribution mechanism can effectively save routing fee, and the waiting time distribution coincides with the model well.

This paper proposes to downsample these data to reduce the storage overhead of nodes. These nodes keep good independence, if downsampling follows the entropy of blockchain and the block bodies are continuously stored. Moreover, it demonstrates that the entire blockchain history can be efficiently recovered through the cooperative decoding of a group of nodes like fountain codes, if reserved data over these nodes obey the soliton distribution. However, these data on nodes are transparent (stored data are uncoded and can be used directly by the node without decoding). Thus, the proposed algorithm not only keeps decentralization and security, but also has good scalability in independence and recoverability.

In the framework, ASPs can flexibly delegate their authentication capabilities to the blockchain, and users authorized by different ASPs can be authenticated by the blockchain where the authentication events are publicly audited and traced. Since the blockchain is publicly accessible, users&#x2019; sensitive identity attributes may be exposed during the authentication process. To address privacy leakage caused by the authentication events, several privacy-preserving techniques, including threshold-based homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and random permutation, are exploited to hide users&#x2019; sensitive information on the blockchain. Moreover, to improve user revocation efficiency, we integrate a cryptographic accumulator and secure hash functions into the framework where ASPs are allowed to revoke their users through a global revocation contract.

As a CNI, Electronic Healthcare System (EHS) infrastructure records citizens&#x2019; medical records, raising security and privacy concerns. Traditional EHS functions independently where patients&#x2019; records are recorded and maintained in centralized systems that produce massive redundant data. Due to the non-coherence of these systems, data atomicity is not maintained; hence research results based on these data create questioning. Moreover, medical records are valuable for research but cannot be public due to security and privacy. Blockchain (BC) is currently considered a potential solution for the challenges. Blockchain can integrate every independent EHS as a bridging platform. The solution can ensure data uniqueness and overcome security issues. The prime difficulties for the integration are data synchronization of the traditional EHS and BC-based EHS. Furthermore, the autonomous interoperability between SQL and NoSQL database used in typical EHS and BC-based EHS, respectively, is a prime challenge. Therefore, this research proposes a Blockchain-based framework that bridges Traditional E-Health Systems(TEHS) and allows uninterruptible data exchanges between two systems, even for archive medical records. Beyond that, the framework shows an elevated way to overcome a single point of failure, data security, access control, etc., issues in a centralized system.

In a blockchain-based crowdsourcing system (BCS), incentive becomes essential to motivate participation and cooperation of all system entities. However, existing literature scarcely investigates how to motivate heterogeneous crowdsourcers, workers and miners simultaneously towards satisfying multiple objectives without the support of centralized management. In this paper, we propose GAIMMO, a novel grade-driven auction-based incentive mechanism for BCS with multiple objectives in mind: crowdsourcer utility maximization, social welfare maximization, social grade maximization, and social cost minimization. Concretely, we propose a grade-based task sorting (GTS) algorithm to determine service priority of heterogeneous crowdsourcers in order to motivate their cooperative behaviors, which consequently maximizes crowdsourcer utility when combining with the carefully designed utility functions of other system entities. We propose a grade-based utility function of workers and employ a hierarchical premium-based task assignment (PTA) algorithm to realize social welfare maximization, social grade maximization and social cost minimization. We further propose a fixed-grade-sum and grade-based reward sharing (FGSGRS) method to encourage fast block generation and motivate high-grade miners without damaging the profits of the crowdsourcers. We conduct simulation-based experiments to show the effectiveness and advance of our proposed incentive mechanism in stimulating participation willingness of high-grade system entities and achieving the multiple objectives.

Current systems for managing prescription records suffer from data siloing, unnecessary record duplication, and slow record transfers. In many systems, patients do not retain control over their prescription data. Instead, they must use an intermediary to access or transfer their records. Furthermore, record transfers suffer from differing standards between providers, outdated communication methods, and information blocking. Solving these problems necessitates the creation of an interoperable prescription management system. Realizing such a system requires considering security, efficiency, scalability, and other challenges. Recent regulatory actions attempt to address these challenges, but fundamental issues persist. This paper proposes a patient-centric and interoperable prescription system that ensures patient control, prevents information blocking, and improves transfer efficiency. We call our solution VigilRx - a system that uses blockchain and smart contracts to manage prescriptions. Stakeholders exist as one of three role-based smart contracts within the system: patient, prescriber, or pharmacy. These role contracts ensure the system is patient-centric by assigning ownership of prescription records directly to patients. Our smart contracts also ensure the system's interoperability, as we use a standardized prescription contract to ensure records can be easily managed. VigilRx's use of blockchain also promotes transparency by providing patients an explicit list of parties that hold permission to access their records. Use of existing software patterns allows the system to adapt as needed. We implement VigilRx and show that it is both scalable and efficient. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; electronic health records; Ethereum; healthcare; prescriptions; smart contractsAccess control; Blockchain; Efficiency; Ethereum; Health care; Interoperability; Block-chain; Blockings; Current system; Health care providers; Management systems; Medical services; Prescription; Software; Stakeholder; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

But there are some problems like centralized provenance data (PD) collection, storage, lack of security, integrity, and more time consumption. There are methods like Rabin, Knapsack, McEliece, Elagamal, and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman for the generation of keys but it increases the encryption and decryption time and less security. Therefore, the blockchain and smart contract-based data provenance (BSCDP) Architecture is proposed for providing secure storage in the cloud environment. Initially, the fingerprint biometrics and physically uncloneable functions (PUF) have been used in verification process. The combination of PUF and fingerprint biometrics is used for secure data transmission. To protect privacy and strengthen the security, the fuzzy extractor is employed. Secondly, we use an elliptic-curve key based cyclic shift transposition cryptography algorithm for enhancing the security when sharing the key. Thirdly, we introduce the blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for PD collection, hash computation, and storing with reduced computational overhead (CO). The integrity of data is maintained by using blockchain based secure hashing algorithm-3. By arranging fuzzy based smart contracts (FSC), the data user (DU) tracks their data. FSC is employed for tracking the history of data. The data collected is directly stored in IPFS and the DU gets a hash from IPFS to retrieve the data in the future. Finally, the data verification is done by the provenance auditor. When comparing our proposed BSCDP method with existing methods, the proposed BSCDP method achieves high security in the cloud environment for 2 K users in terms of evidence insertion time (30 ms), verification time (30 ms), response time (40 ms), total change rate (5%), CO (5.8 Kb), encryption (50 ms) and decryption time (52 ms). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","And IPFS; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Cloud service provider; Cyclic shift transportation algorithm; Data provenanceBiometrics; Cloud security; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; And interplanetary file system; Block-chain; Cloud environments; Cloud service providers; Cloud-computing; Cyclic shift transportation algorithm; Cyclic shifts; Data collection; Data provenance; Filesystem; Smart contract","C");

The dRNG algorithm is one of the key challenges in developing the consensus mechanism, as well as one of the relevant parameters for determining the merit of the consensus mechanism. In this paper, we first derive a publicly verifiable quantum random numbers generation protocol based on the certifiable randomness scheme from any untrusted quantum device, which offers features, such as fairness, no trusted third party, and publicly verifiable. Then, based on verifiable quantum random numbers, we propose a new consensus algorithm. The algorithm selects block proposer and block verification committees for each round using verifiable quantum random numbers, resulting in better randomness, fairness, and efficiency of the entire consensus process.

Consensus algorithms are a prominent component in decentralized systems involving multiple unreliable nodes. Since the days Blockchain was first introduced, decentralized systems have been used in many applications such as supply chain management and information sharing paradigms. Raft is a consensus algorithm based on “Paxos” that is used for replicated state machines when a group of nodes is required to have the same state at any moment. This paper therefore proposes an alternative version of the Raft consensus algorithm to allow sharing information among nodes in a secured fashion while maintaining the security features of the original Raft algorithm even in the presence of adversarial nodes. The proposed model can be implemented to improve cooperation among parties, especially, in resource-constrained platforms where a regular encrypted communication method can heavily affect the system.

Linguistically, a portmanteau combines deep learning aspects of AI with the doctored or falsified enhancements that deem the content fake and now deepfake or misinformation results. A variety of sophisticated software programs’ exacting algorithms create high-quality videos and manipulated audio of people who may not exist, twisting others who do exist, creating the potential for leading to the spread of serious misinformation often with serious consequences. The rate of detection of this digital emergence is proliferating exponentially and the sourcing is challenging to verify, causing alarms. Examples of this pervasive information warfare are is associated with deepfakes that range from identity theft, discrediting public figures and celebrities, cyberbullying, blackmail, threats to national security, personal privacy, intensifying pornography and sexual exploitation, cybersecurity, baiting hate crimes, abusing social media platforms and manipulating metadata. Deepfakes that are difficult to cite, acquire, or track have some parallel attributes to grey literature by that definition. Often detectable, yet problematic, activities such as phishing and robocalling may be common attempts of deepfake activities that threaten and interrupt rhythms of daily life. The increasing online personas that many people create or assume contribute to this fake content and potential for escalated exploitation due to technical abilities to copy and reimagine details that are not true. AI image generators create completely false images of people that simply don’t exist within seconds and are nearly impossible to track. While AI is perceived as a positive benefit for science and policy, it can have negative roles in this new AI threatened environment. Deepfakes have crossover targets in common business applications and society at large. Examples of this blur are targeted advertising, undetected security cameras in public spaces, blockchain, tabloid press/paparazzi, entertainment, computer games, online publishing, data and privacy, courtroom testimony, public opinion, scientific evidence, political campaigns, and rhetoric. This paper explores the impact and intersections of these behaviors and activities, products of AI, and emerging technologies with how digital grey and the optics of grey expose the dangers of deepfakes on everyday life. Applying a security and privacy lens, we offer insights of extending libel and slander into more serious criminal behavior as deepfakes become more pervasive, construing reality, endangering personal, social, and global safety nets adding to the new normal we assume today.

Secondly, we use the untamable blockchain to store biometric public information, and the threat of the fuzzy extraction technology which is vulnerable to be active attacked was solved. Finally, based on the distributed storage function and consortium blockchain architecture, we achieve the biometrics cross domain authentication of user in local and remote environment.

These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces.

Big- data mining tools can perform pattern recognition assignments from thousands to billions of blockchain communications to recognize evil users and fraudulent transactions. The current information extraction algorithms have the limitations of large memory occupation, long running time, high dimensionality, low extraction accuracy, poor convergence precision and slow convergence speed. There is a need to devise newer techniques with the potential of fast and accurate information extraction features in blockchain based systems to support high risk international financial transactions. Thus, in this paper, the automatic extraction algorithm of data mining as a case study of blockchain communications based on QACS (quantum adaption cuckoo search) method is proposed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to map the original features of blockchain communications into low-dimensional feature space through linear transformation, and then to replace the original features with fewer absolutely needed features. The features of coding information in information management system are reduced, and the optimal feature subset is obtained. K-means is used to extract the key information in the optimal feature subset. An improved and adaptive Cuckoo search is proposed in this paper where quantum operation is introduced into the original K-means algorithm for automatic extraction of coded information in blockchain communications. The results prove that the proposed QACS method has the potential of automatic extraction of the encoded information with lower execution time, higher extraction accuracy, and faster convergence speed, and is significant for blockchain based systems. © 2022 IETE.","Automatic extraction; blockchain communications; cuckoo search; K-means; QACS (quantum adaption cuckoo search)Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Information management; Information retrieval; K-means clustering; Linear transformations; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Search engines; Automatic extraction; Block-chain; Blockchain communication; Cuckoo searches; Extraction accuracy; Extraction algorithms; K-means; Quantum adaption cuckoo search; Search method; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Technological revolution with Internet of Things (IoTs) has developed various applications in almost all domains from health care, education to entertainment with sensors and smart devices. One of the subsets of IoT is Internet of Medical things (IoMT) which connects medical devices, hardware and software applications through internet. IoMT enables secure wireless communication over the Internet to allow efficient analysis of medical data.With these smart advancements and exploitation of smart IoT devices in health care technology there increases threat and malware attacks during transmission of highly confidential medical data. This work proposes a scheme by integrating machine learning approach and block chain technology to detect malware during data transmission in IoMT. The proposed Machine Learning based Block Chain Technology malware detection scheme (MLBCT-Mdetect) is implemented in three steps namely: Feature extraction, Classification and blockchain. Feature extraction is performed by calculating the weight of each feature and reduces the features with less weight. Support Vector Machine classifier is employed in the second step to classify the malware and benign nodes. Furthermore, third step uses blockchain to store details of the selected features which eventually improves the detection of malware with significant improvement in speed and accuracy.ML-BCT-Mdetect achieves higher accuracy with low false positive rate and higher True positive rate. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Proposing smart algorithms for fast parking is crucial not only to facilitate drivers, but also to reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and vehicle energy consumption. Typically, an urban area has several competitive car parks and, in order to make the parking process automatic, a mechanism to ensure a fair competition among them is needed. Among all the methods able to guarantee transparency and equity in a system, blockchain is a robust technology. It has been successfully applied in many different research fields, from financial to health. In this work, we provide an automatic parking system in which vehicles are allocated among several competitive parking areas (called competitors), through a blockchain-based approach, by applying a consensus mechanism to manage the system modifications. To this aim, two classes of fairness constraints are defined, according to which any new operation on the parking consortium must be approved by the members.

Therefore, a new housing price trend prediction model based on a sequential modular F-type data mining algorithm is designed which can collect information through a blockchain environment. This paper selects location grade, traffic condition, interior area, building structure, building time, and building quality as parameters and generalizes them. By using the method of correlation analysis, we can find out the attributes with a high degree of correlation and complete the variable selection of influencing factors of housing price. Using the housing price sequence model, the characteristics of housing price data are extracted and the data information entropy is obtained. The information entropy is used to reduce the dimension of data space and complete the prediction of house prices using data mining. The phase space of the housing price time series is reconstructed, and the housing price trend prediction model is constructed. The experimental results show that the housing price data mining time of the designed model is shorter, and the price trend prediction accuracy is higher.

The blockchain protocol requires that full nodes need to save the complete blockchain data, which limits the joining of resource-constrained nodes. A small number of full nodes will reduce the decentralize and security of system. Elasticchain was proposed in 2018 to solve this problem by saving fragments of the entire blockchain in reliable nodes. However, Elasticchain does not give an effective method to evaluate the reliability of nodes. If the fragmented data is stored in unreliable nodes, such as malicious tampering, are often not online or the latency is too high, the security of blockchain system will be seriously impacted. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an ELM-based method to comprehensively evaluate node reliability, and the blockchain system distributes the fragmented data to reliable nodes for storage. In the new method, ELM is used as a classifier to select reliable nodes because the ELM has a higher performance of training and classification compared to other machine models. Moreover, in ELM classifier five novel evaluation features are considered: the security, the trustworthiness, the activeness, the stability and the communication costs.

We implement a LION prototype on an active Bitcoin node to show that LION yields less than 1% of mining rate reduction subject to our prototype, in contrast to the state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches costing 12% or more depending on the algorithms subject to our prototype, while having detection accuracy of greater than 97% F1-score against the attack prototypes and real-world anomalies. LION therefore can be deployed on the existing miners without the need to introduce new entities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In most e-coupon services, the information of e-coupons is managed on a centralized server. However, e-coupon services are often vulnerable to security issues because of centralization. For example, when the e-coupon information which is stored in a centralized e-coupon server is forged, it becomes difficult to match the user and the e-coupon's owner, and an expired e-coupon can be used repetitively (i.e., double-spending). To handle this issue, we propose a new e-coupon service by exploiting a blockchain system to improve the security of the service. To do this, we first design a server to enable the e-coupon service and communicate with the blockchain system. Second, we devise a smart contract on the blockchain system to provide integrity of the e-coupon business logic and the e-coupon's information. We implemented the proposed service on an Ethereum-based blockchain system. The experimental results show that our proposed service improves higher security with a minor performance overhead compared with an existing e-coupon service. © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; E-coupon; security; smart contractBlock-chain; Centralisation; Centralised; Centralized server; E- commerces; E-coupon; First designs; Security; Security issues; Service-based; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

When the blockchain technology is applied to decentralize traditional applications (DApps), blockchain validators may need to take in sensitive off-chain data to execute a smart contract. On the one hand, DApps require the off-chain input data to be authentic for correction execution of business procedures. On the other hand, users are afraid of exposing their sensitive privacy on the blockchain. Therefore, it is critical to guarantee authenticity and privacy of the data sent to the smart contract. However, no satisfactory solution has been proposed to attain privacy and authenticity simultaneously. In this work, we first present an authenticated zero knowledge proof scheme called zk-DASNARK by extending the classical zk-SNARK scheme. Based on zk-DASNARK, we design zk-AuthFeed, a zero-knowledge authenticated off-chain data feed scheme to achieve both data privacy and authenticity for blockchain-based DApps. We fully implement zk-AuthFeed, and conduct comprehensive experiments on a medical insurance DApp. We consider 4 typical computation models for insurance premium/reimbursement in the experiments.

These things, along with their generated huge amount of data, need to be handled efficiently and securely. Centralized solutions are not desired due to security concerns and scalability issue. In this paper, we propose HIBEChain, a hierarchical blockchain system that realizes scalable and accountable management of IoT devices and data. HIBEChain consists of multiple permissioned blockchains that form a hierarchical tree structure. To support the hierarchical structure of HIBEChain, we design a decentralized hierarchical identity-based signature (DHIBS) scheme, which enables IoT devices to use their identities as public keys. Consequently, HIBEChain achieves high scalability through parallel processing as blockchain sharding schemes, and it also implements accountability by use of identity-base keys. Identity-based keys not only make HIBEChain more user-friendly, they also allow private key recovery by validators when necessary. We provide detailed analysis of its security and performance, and implement HIBEChain based on Ethereum source code.

Further, vehicular computation offloading often occurs between unfamiliar vehicles, how to motivate vehicles to share their computing resources while guaranteeing the reliability of resource allocation in task offloading is one main challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled VEC framework to ensure the reliability and efficiency of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) task offloading.

Although there have been many improved algorithms for PBFT in recent years, they ignore fault tolerance and democracy. Therefore, to meet the requirements of a high degree of decentralization and fault tolerance of blockchain-based scenarios. This paper proposes a high fault tolerance consensus algorithm NBFT, which follows the principle of decentralization and democratization of blockchain and ensures the improvement of performance in fault tolerance upper limit and scalability. First, we use the consistent hash algorithm to group the consensus nodes to avoid much communication between nodes, reduce the communication complexity of the network, and improve the scalability of the network. Second, to ensure the fault-tolerant ability of the grouping consensus, the nodal decision broadcast model and threshold vote-counting model are proposed first. Combined with the proposed two models, the joint fault analysis of nodes is carried out, and the fault tolerance upper limit is more than 1/3. Then, the Faulty Number Determined(FND) model is introduced to simulate the experiment, and the results are verified.

Datalog is a high-level declarative logic language that is generally used for querying. Furthermore, as a logic language, it can also be used to solve logic problems. An application using Circuitree can efficiently generate ZKPs, based on Datalog rules and encrypted data, to prove that a certain conclusion follows from a Datalog ruleset and encrypted input data. Compared to existing frameworks, which generally use their own limited imperative languages, Circuitree uses an existing high-level declarative language.

However, high-fidelity models of digital twins raise the requirement of efficient data flows, which is limited by realistic constraints such as data collection strategy and energy supply. We propose a sustainable data collection and management approach to construct digital twins for physical assets. With this approach, data packets are uploaded to the data brokers, namely agents, by a large number of IoT devices. The challenge lies in the balance between enduring data collection and the information loss associated with the stale data.

So, preventing selfish mining is an important objective. There have been a few attempts to prevent selfish mining. In this work, we focus on alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms that try to discourage selfish miners by extending their waiting time for selfish mining to become profitable, Zeno’s DAA in particular. We propose two extensions on Zeno’s DAA: 1) Zeno’s Max DAA, which increase the difficulty in one step but decreases it in multiple steps, and 2) Zeno’s Parametric DAA that has a parameter that can be tuned to control the rate of the decrement (or increment) in the value of difficulty. We evaluate these two alternatives DAAs and show that Zeno’s Max performs better than Zeno’s for scalability of the network and scales the network faster. Also, Zeno’s Parametric is a family of DAAs that not only has the default DAA and Zeno’s DAA as its members but also can include anything in between or even DAAs more conservative than Zeno’s, which decrease the difficulty even slower than Zeno’s. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bitcoin network; Blockchain; Difficulty adjustment algorithm; Selfish miningBitcoin; Adjustment algorithms; Bitcoin network; Block-chain; Difficulty adjustment algorithm; Mining process; Proof of work; Selfish mining; Waiting time; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

However, while a deal of effort has been spent on selling works of art on the blockchain, very little attention has been paid to using the blockchain as a means of fundraising to help finance the artist’s work in the first place. Additionally, while blockchains like Ethereum are ideal for smaller works of art, additional support is needed when the artwork is larger than is feasible to store on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a fundraising mechanism that will help artists to gain financial support for their initiatives, and where the backers can receive a share of the profits in exchange for their support.

More commonly, there is a need for getting them verified from multiple external sources in a decentralized manner. This kind of architecture is also more robust against security and privacy attacks as compared to a centralized system. However, it is imperative that authorization by the independent sources be done in a transparent and verifiable manner. In this paper, we propose a method for decentralized authorization using the Ethereum blockchain. We consider the underlying authorization model to be Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) and hence, the credentials to be verified are the attributes of the users making access requests to the web service. In ABAC, a user is granted or denied access to an object based on her attributes as well as those of the requested object using a set of rules (called the ABAC policy). We use a public blockchain, namely Ethereum, for transparent authorization of attributes by multiple sources to allow the web service to take an access decision. It ensures that the authorization data is immutable and helps in building trust between the users, web service providers and attribute certifying authorities. We have made a prototype implementation of our proposed architecture on the Rinkeby Ethereum test network. Extensive experiments show its scalability in realistic scenarios. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC); Decentralized authorization; Ethereum; Smart contract; Web servicesAuthorization; Network architecture; Web services; Websites; Attribute based access control; Attribute-based access control; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized authorization; External sources; Privacy Attacks; Security and privacy; Security attacks; Webs services; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

However, with the advancement in technology in Industry 4.0 has evolved the role of the Smart Grid (SG) network. SG network is a two-way bi-directional communication Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Whereas traditional grid network is a one-way directional physical system. SG is a part of the most revolutionary application of Internet-of-Things (IoT). The information related to power consumption and supplies can be transmitted and recorded in real-time. The connection of SG with the internet has also created a lot of space for different types of anomalies injection and cyber-physical attacks. SG network is open and vulnerable to an outside hacker. The detection of an anomaly in real-time is of utmost importance otherwise it may lead to huge power loss, security, and monetary loss to the consumer, producer, and smart city society. In this paper, we have proposed a private blockchain system model for anomaly detection in SG along with a novel Linear Support Vector Machine Anomaly Detection (LSVMAD) algorithm in a fog computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will act as miners to support and make real-time decisions for anomaly detection in an SG network. The anomaly detection accuracy of the LSVMAD algorithm in the FC environment is 89% and in the cloud is 78%. The proposed LSVMAD algorithm easily outperforms the existing techniques and algorithms when compared for anomaly detection accuracy percentage.

The main measure used to contain the rapid spread and to control this virus’s contamination rate is social distancing. This method has dramatically affected citizens’ daily lives. To this end, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual meetings using cloud videoconferencing application solutions has emerged. This approach has indeed solved this problem for millions of schools, companies, governments, and individuals worldwide. However, security and privacy concerns arise. The number of videoconferencing users has increased during the pandemic, yet some applications offer only unencrypted communication for unpaid users. Moreover, uninvited attendees can join virtual meetings, collect sensitive information about users and shared files, and participate in them using deepfake tools. To resolve this dilemma, we propose in this paper a lightweight, scalable blockchain-based authentication mechanism to secure cloud videoconferencing. Private blockchain, as a decentralized network, can handle user authentication and provide complete data privacy to shared information in a virtual meeting. Moreover, to reduce the latency and mining processing overhead and for scalability of the system, we use a time-based consensus algorithm.

As a tool in the e- learning process, the LMS provides several benefits that can help overcome problems that often occur during the learning process. However, the current deployment of LMS as a learning medium still has its limitations such as low engagement and motivation, secure documents, certification, and exam verification to replace a cumbersome manual process, and ultimately personalization of features that relevant to students’ requirements. Recently, some new technologies developed as recent trends to tackle the various difficulties and challenges relevant to these issues and obstacles. In this sense, the Gamification design boosted users’ interaction and engagement with the online system by adding a new game concept. Similarly, blockchain technology improves the security of online document exchange, verification, and storage. Ultimately, learning analytics demonstrated to allow the personalization of online platforms based on interactions and data logs. In this work, we studied how combining these strategies might boost the LMS performance and tackle existing issues and problems.

The most prominent use of digital certificates is found in the HTTPS protocol, for securing websites and clients by means of digital signatures and public-key encryption. Because digital certificates are signed by Certificate Authorities that supposedly everyone trusts, it is implicitly said that these certificates provide some degree of trustworthiness. But history shows us that Certificate Authorities can also make mistakes, issue false certificates or be compromised in some form or another. Also, currently there are multiple types of digital certificates that can be issued: DV, OV and EV, which cost differently based on the grade of trust. We believe that real trust should not be quantifiable in degrees of trust: we either trust a certificate or we don’t.

Fake news is spreading in large numbers in this internet era as social media provide an easy way to share it without any authentication. Fake news may have multiple forms like text and images, from which we can extract features to identify the patterns and operations applied on the images. Objective of the system is to build the model for “Detection of fake news presented as image” problem. Deep learning algorithms can be used to develop approaches which can detect tampered images retrieved from any source. However, it is challenging to determine the tampered images as it requires training of models to differentiate between the actual images and tampered images in order to classify it as fake. Automatic separating of fake news requires thorough investigation of images data to get explicit features from the images used in the fake news. With the use of CNN, the images features including the hidden patterns are extracted using the multiple convolutional layers. People upload and spread images over the internet and there is no control on the authenticity and ownership on their own photos. Images stored can be audited to trace the transactions applied on the images using the smart contracts deployed on blockchain. Image forgery detection using convolutional neural network with blockchain (CNNB) is proposed in this work where we combine blockchain technology with image processing techniques using deep learning to build a new hybrid model for mining the tampered images used in the news. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Convolutional neural network; Fake news; Image forensic; Image tampering; Smart contracts","非CCF推荐");

Our calculation showed about 10 28 hashes have been generated during bitcoin mining around the world for securing the addition of 703,364 blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. We introduced a concept of Recycling Hashes in the hope to (a) jump-start bespoke silicon (customized silicon) for reversible computing, (b) open up the possibility of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work to be less energy-consuming in the future, (c) provide scientific value or new services, in the form of entropy pool or random numbers, to Internet users while still achieving the security level of Bitcoin of today, (d) decrease the old mining hardware e-waste by using them to recycle hashes to the entropy pool, and (e) solve the problem of low mining rewards. We found that the bit rates of the current irreversible bitcoin miners are millions of times as high as the existing Internet connections, so it would be difficult to send all the hashes generated in real-time via the Internet. Even if only 0.000000355% of the hashes can be recycled, it would still mean that 355 · 10 18 hashes (355 EH) would have been recycled since the beginning of Bitcoin. Storing all the hashes, so far, would need storage of 2.560 · 10 30 bits, and it is not currently possible to keep all of them. Our simulation of 10,000 bitcoin hashes showed that the occurrences of zeros and ones in bitcoin hashes are almost 50% and 50%, so it is an encouraging finding for seeding the Pseudorandom Number Generators.

Hence, cryptographic primitives lie at the heart of several modern digital technologies. In this work, we study one such important cryptographic primitive called commitment. Here two parties, say Alice and Bob, aim to realize a protocol with the following functionality: Alice seeks to share or commit to a bit string securely with Bob with the requirement that the string is hidden from Bob until she chooses to reveal it to him. Bob wants to ensure that the protocol binds Alice to her original choice of bit string by allowing him to successfully detect when she cheats at the time of revealing her string. This seemingly elementary cryptographic functionality is extremely powerful and finds wide use in technologies like blockchains, digital contracts, cryptocurrencies, etc.. More generally, commitment has also been widely studied for applications like sealed-bid auctions, distributed coin tossing, etc.. Building on Wyner's classic work on wiretap channels, unconditionally-secure or information-theoretically secure protocols have been realized for a wide variety of problems, including commitment, using noisy channels as a resource. Crucially, however, the security guarantees are intimately tied to the knowledge of the noise statistics; these could be compromised when noise statistics are imprecisely known. In this work, we seek to study information-theoretically secure commitment over a class of unreliable noisy channels called compound channels. In particular, we study commitment over compound discrete memoryless channels (compound-DMCs) where the instantiated channel is known to be a DMC but its realization or channel state is not known exactly and can only be localized to a potential set of possible states. We precisely characterize the optimal throughput or commitment capacity over general compound DMCs. We also study the effect of state-awareness at the two parties, when the parties are honest and when they are malicious, on the commitment capacity of such compound DMCs. Interestingly, we show that committer-side state-awareness can non-trivially increase the commitment throughput over the compound DMC which is not the case when one has only receiver-side state awareness. In particular, we completely characterize the commitment capacity for all state-aware configurations for compound DMCs. © 2022 IEEE.","blockchains; Commitment; compound channel; hash functions; information-theoretic security; privacy amplificationBlockchain; Information theory; Bit-strings; Block-chain; Commitment; Compound channel; Cryptographic primitives; Information- theoretic securities; Noise statistics; Noisy channel; Privacy amplification; Ubiquitous data; Hash functions","非CCF推荐");

Our light-weight approach reduces the overhead by eliminating the nonce of traditional blockchains, thereby bringing down the delay in arriving at a consensus. Each edge device is equipped with a machine learning algorithm to classify data and the predicted classifications are used to arrive at the consensus. The use of different machine learning algorithms at the edge nodes improves the robustness of our system.

However, a very small portion of it gets recycled, primarily due to improper waste management and lack of access to the plastic recycling infrastructure. Hence, we position that plastic waste, if handled carefully and in a timely manner, the percentage of recycled plastic waste can be significantly increased. Such recycling can transform used plastic objects into plastic bricks, plastic plant pots, plastic fibres, or social plastics. A few organizations do these recycling jobs; however, they need a vast amount of plastic materials to be made available in a timely manner for effective recycling - noteworthy a need for an effective and transparent supply-chain system. Hence, we propose building a Blockchain-based decentralized application through which these organizations can collect plastics from anyone and track them in a timely manner. Further, transparency of the process and associated rewards system (non-monetary) for Blockchain transactions can greatly incentivize the users to recycle the plastics. Thus, a Blockchain-based distributed management system with a right incentive structure can help bridge the gap between users and organizations, and help towards reducing the footprint of plastic waste. © 2022 IEEE.","Blockchain; Plastic Waste ManagementElastomers; Plastic recycling; Plastics; Supply chains; Waste management; Block-chain; Decentralised; Plastic fibers; Plastic materials; Plastic waste management; Plastics recycling; Plastics waste; Recycled plastics; Reward systems; Supply chain systems; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

The protocol restricts any intermediaries/third-parties to use the identity or proof without authorization of the user. The protocol is fully automated through smart contracts and makes sure that credential verification is settled in near real time.

In this paper, we propose a novel signaling scheme of PoW called Anchors that can be implemented on any PoW blockchain system to improve their stability, reduce fork resolution times, prevent forks, strengthen the system against double spend attacks and reduce block confirmation times by half. In a partially synchronous model with a general adversary, we prove that a system with anchors has faster, more stable chain growth as compared to PoW systems without anchors and show that consistency security bounds established by prior work are preserved as in the underlying blockchain. We incorporate anchors in a reference Bitcoin implementation and perform experiments to support our claims in a 210 node test-bed with real world latencies.

In these systems, optimization is achieved through the interactions of many individuals/particles/agents. However, when the system is implemented in a distributed environment, reliability becomes an issue. In such an environment, it may not be possible to trust others. There are numerous cases which we cannot guarantee trust, such as malfunction of distributed parts or failure to synchronize. Therefore, we have to make trust between distributed individuals/particles/agents. The record of past actions is usually a good tool for generating trust.

By discussing the different adjustment mechanisms of deep transfer learning under MMD metric and Wasserstein metric, we can see that, in the MMD metric model, through analyzing datasets 1 and 2, the highest accuracy rate is 83.1% under multisource weight adjustment mechanism under MMD metric and the lower accuracy rate is 62.7% under no weight adjustment mechanism, and the accuracy rates of datasets 1 and 2 are higher than the average. Under Wasserstein metric, the accuracy of dataset 1 is 82.5% under multisource weight and 68.5% under no source weight, both of which are higher than the average. Three EEGNet models, EEGNet_0, EEGNet_1, and EEGNet_2, were established for comparative testing; according to the test results, it can be seen that EEGNet_1 has high accuracy and can be preferred for system establishment. By comparing the Chinese-Korean translation model with the blockchain model and the traditional translation model, it can be seen that when the translation sentences are 100 sentences, the average response time and peak traffic response time of the Chinese-Korean translation model are lower than those of the traditional translation model and the test conclusion is passed. When the test sentences are 1000 sentences, the average response time and peak traffic corresponding time of the Chinese-Korean translation model are still lower than those of the traditional method. Therefore, it can be seen that the efficiency and winning rate of the Chinese-Korean translation model are higher than those of the traditional translation system and meet the needs. According to the analysis of the performance test results of the translation system, it can be seen that the average response time and success rate of the Chinese and Korean translation system under different data are higher than those of the traditional translation system. When the test data are 500, the average response time of the translation system is 13 ms and the accuracy rate is 100%. When the test data are 3000, the average response time is 99 ms and the success rate is 99.6%.

This paper adds a collaborative verification module to the traceability system and carries out a detailed design of information storage, traceability consensus algorithm, and smart contract for agricultural products according to the characteristics of the agricultural products supply chain, among which the collaborative verification module adopts dynamic data storage technology; the ConsiderVinia consensus algorithm is improved by introducing the way of integral penalty mechanism to ensure the block data validity. After a comparative study of the features and differences of the three major blockchain technology platforms, this paper selects the super ledger to implement the agricultural traceability system based on blockchain technology, introduces the partitioning and credit mechanism into the ConsiderVinia algorithm, and elaborates the improvement process of the algorithm. The improved algorithm reduces the malicious behavior of nodes and maintains the system security through a credit mechanism while maintaining the consistency of blockchain. In the event of a transaction dispute, the third-party platform will determine the party at fault based on the transaction records and other evidence and make corresponding punishments and compensations.

In such networks, data can be exposed to a variety of attacks, the most dangerous is false information dissemination, which threatens the safety and efficiency of transportation systems. False emergency messages can be injected by inside attackers to announce fake incidents such as traffic accidents, resulting in a false information attack. As the data in VANET is based on events, any trust mechanism must first identify the true events. To address these security challenges, a blockchain-based authentication scheme and trust management model are proposed for VANETs. Using the authentication scheme, vehicles are enabled to send messages anonymously to the roadside units (RSUs) and the identity privacy of vehicles is protected. Besides, the proposed trust management model is designed to detect and deal with false information by evaluating the trustworthiness of vehicles and data. Using the trust model, when vehicles report an incident to the nearest RSU, the RSU is able to verify whether or not the incident took place. This mechanism ensures that RSUs send only verified event notifications. Finally, RSUs participate in updating the trust values of vehicles and store these values in the blockchain. The efficiency of the proposed authentication scheme is validated through analysis while the trust model is validated through simulations. The results obtained show that the proposed authentication scheme and the trust model provide better performance than other state-of-the-art models where malicious vehicles can be identified efficiently and RSUs are enabled to broadcast only legitimate events. © 2022 The Authors.

This process involves a number of stakeholders from manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, pharmacies and finally end-users, the patients. At each stage, inventory must be managed based on demand in pharmaceutical products. Inventory management system is vital because an excess of inventory could cost the pharmacy money and it is more complex because it needs to track the lot numbers and expiration dates of medicines. Pharmaceutical supply chain suffers from various issues such as drug shortages, temperature control of drugs, lack of visibility in shipment and storage, inventory management, lack of coordination and the most important one drug counterfeiting. The principal regulatory bodies responsible for drug quality try to solve these issues by various ways. But they are very much unregulated, expensive and fragmented. The blossoming technology, Blockchain by its inherent properties such as immutability, transparency, and distributed nature could solve the problems of pharmaceutical supply chain. This paper starts with an introduction about Drug supply chain and their problems. It elucidates how Blockchain Technology could come to rescue pharmaceutical supply chain. This paper proposes a novel drug supply chain management system along with inventory management based on Blockchain 2.0 specifically Hyperledger Fabric. The proposed system records all transactions using Blockchain, thus helping in tracking the drug along its supply chain as well as solving the issues associated with drug supply chain in an efficient manner. It also measures performance of the proposed system using the Benchmark tool called Hyperledger caliper. The system proves its efficiency in terms of success rate, throughput and transaction latency. © 2022, Engg Journals Publications.

We face a lot of issues, such as doctor's appointments, report organization in one spot, and report follow-ups. People now bring a large number of papers to the doctor's chamber. They carry prescriptions, reports, and X-ray files, among other things. It complicates everyone's life as a result. All of the reports must be reviewed by doctors on a regular basis. It is difficult to read old reports on a regular basis, and patients do not receive the correct medications or treatment. Doctors also find it extremely difficult to comprehend handwritten prescriptions. Data security, authenticity, time management, and other areas of data administration are dramatically improved when blockchain (smart contract) technology is linked with standard database management solutions. Blockchain is a groundbreaking, decentralized technology that protects data from unauthorized access. After smart contracts are implemented, the management will be satisfied with the patients. As a result, maintaining data privacy and accountability in the system is tough. It signifies that the information is only accessible to those who have been authenticated. This study focuses on limiting third-party engagement in medical health data and improving data security. Throughout the process, this will improve accessibility and time efficiency. People will feel safer during the payment procedure, which is the most significant benefit. A smart contract and a peer-to-peer encrypted technology were used. The hacker will not be able to gain access to this system since this document uses an immutable ledger. They will not be able to change any of the data if they gain access to the system. If the items are found to be defective, the transaction will be halted. Transaction security will be a viable option for recasting these problems using cryptographic methodologies. We developed a website where patients and doctors will both benefit because of the use of blockchain technology to ensure the security of medical data. We have different profiles for doctors and patients. In the patient profile, they can create their own account by using a unique address, name, and age. This unique address will be created from the genesis block. The unique address is completely private to the owner, who will remain fully secure in our network. After creating an account, the patient can view the doctors' list and they can upload their medical reports such as prescriptions and X-rays. All the records uploaded by the patient will be stored on our local server (Ganache). The records are stored as hashed strings of the data. Those files will also have a unique address, and it will be shown in the patient profile. After granting access, the doctors will be able to view their records in the respective doctor's profile. For accessing the options such as uploading, viewing, or editing the data, Ethereum currency (a fee) will have to be paid in order to complete the request. On the other hand, doctors can enter their profile using their name and unique address. After logging in, they can view their name, unique address, and the list of patients that have granted access to the doctor to view their files. On our website, the front end is handled by JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. The backend is handled by Solidity. Storage is handled by Ganache as the local host.

Node authentication is a crucial part of IoT security. The current authentication solutions require a centralized trusted party for authentication, which presents a single point of failure. Blockchain as a peer-to-peer network with decentralized authentication can provide a decentralized solution for node authentication. In existing literature, most blockchain applications in IoT are connected to existing blockchain networks by more computationally capable devices, thereby limiting their adaptability for IoT networks and presenting single point of failure problem. Considering the issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized structure for authentication by arranging the IoT devices into clusters based on their computational capability, energy reserve and their location. The devices in each cluster are authenticated by a hierarchical structure of interconnected blockchains. To reduce the processing load we introduced a consensus protocol based on verifying identity-based encryption key signature of the device and its related cluster. The proposed structure simulation has shown a reduction of the processor and memory load of IoT devices. Further testing using Docker container network and Raspberry Pi devices network has shown that the proposed blockchain structure and consensus algorithm have reduced computational load.

However, a large number of devices and more messages at the edge bring more security problems. Therefore, it is an important research topic to provide users with faster network services while ensuring confidentiality and authentication of data transmission. Because signcryption can encrypt and sign messages at the same time, it has become a new cryptographic primitive. In the meantime, certificateless signcryption guarantees data confidentiality and authentication and addresses traditional single point failure problems based on the trust center and the problem of relying on a trusted third party. Therefore, certificateless signcryption has attracted great attention from academia and industry. But certificateless signcryption also faces two types of attacks. In order to more effectively resist these two types of attacks, we propose a certificateless signcryption mechanism based on blockchain. This mechanism can make good use of the nontamperable feature of blockchain, prevent illegal users from substituting public key of the user, and guarantee signature non-repudiation. And our scheme is investigated in a comparative study with eight schemes. Comparative analysis outcomes demonstrate our scheme has achieved better results in efficiency and security.

Generally used methods for improvement include mixing protocols, ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic commitments, and off-chain storage systems. To the best of our knowledge, in the literature, there is no study examining Bitcoin in terms of differential privacy, which is a privacy notion coming up with some mechanisms that enable running useful statistical queries without identifying any personal information. In this paper, we provide a theoretical examination of differential privacy in Bitcoin. Our motivation arises from the idea that the Bitcoin public blockchain structure can benefit from differential privacy mechanisms for improved privacy, both making anonymization and privacy breaches by direct queries impossible, and preserving the checkability of the integrity of the blockchain. We first examine the current Bitcoin implementation for four query functions using the differential privacy formulation. Then, we present the feasibility of the utilization of two differential privacy mechanisms in Bitcoin; the noise addition to the transaction amounts and the user graph perturbation. We show that these mechanisms decrease the fraction of the cases violating differential privacy, therefore they can be used for improving anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin. Moreover, we showcase the noise addition to transaction amounts by using IBM Differential Privacy Library.

The buyer prosumers are equipped with electrical storage and can participate in a demand response (DR) program while protecting their privacy. In addition to bilateral negotiating with the local sellers, these players can compensate for their energy deficiency from the upstream market as the retail market at hours without local generation.

First, we introduce a hybrid data-marketing architecture, where the cloud acts as an efficient data management unit and a consortium blockchain serves as a transparent marketing controller. Under the architecture, consent-based secure data trading and identity privacy for data owners are achieved with the distributed credential issuance and threshold credential openings. Second, with a consortium committee, we design a fair on/off-chain data marketing protocol. By financial incentives and succinct &#x2018;commitments&#x2019; of marketing operations, the protocol can achieve the marketing fairness and effective detection of unfair marketing operations. We demonstrate the security of Block-DM with thorough analysis. We conduct extensive experiments with a consortium blockchain network on Hyperledger Fabric to show the feasibility and practicality of Block-DM.

Inclusive protocol was proposed to lower the loss of miners who produce stale blocks and increase the blockchain throughput. This paper aims to make an analytical-model-based quantitative comparison of their capabilities against selfish mining attack. Analytical models have been developed for the longest-chain protocol but less to the GHOST protocol. However, the blockchain dynamics and evolution are different when adopting different chain-selection protocols. Therefore, the corresponding analytical models and/or the formulas of calculating metrics (such as miner profitability and system throughput) may be different. To address these challenges, this paper first develops a novel Markov model and the formulas of evaluation metrics, in order to analyze a GHOST-based blockchain system under selfish mining attack. Then extensive experiments are conducted for comparison and we observe that: (i) The GHOST protocol is more resistant to selfish mining attack than the longest-chain protocol from the aspect of relative revenue of selfish miners. (ii) Inclusive protocol can promote the security (evaluated in terms of miner profitability) improvement of the system which has little total computational power or a high forking probability. Additionally, the longest-chain protocol is more sensitive to inclusive protocol than GHOST protocol.

Data deduplication can be adopted to improve communication efficiency and minimize storage space. However, in edge computing, data deduplication brings security and functionality requirements that are still unsatisfied. Most existing schemes are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and single-point attacks. Moreover, they impose a heavy burden on resource-constrained edge nodes and do not support cross-domain deduplication. Blockchain is a promising technology because the programmable smart contract can be utilized to perform cross-domain deduplication and guarantee the traceability of data. In this paper, an efficient dynamic cross-domain deduplication scheme in blockchain-enabled edge computing is proposed to solve the above problems. Specifically, the smart contract is employed to assist cross-domain deduplication, which also can reduce the storage pressure of edge nodes. Meanwhile, a hash proof system-based oblivious pseudo-random function is created to reduce time cost of key generation and achieve the security requirements of resistance to brute-force attacks and single-point attacks. The technology of accumulators is adopted to achieve &#x201C;Proofs of Ownership" (PoO), which can prevent duplicate-faking attacks. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has a higher security level. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme significantly reduces computation cost and communication overhead, compared with other existing schemes. The smart contract is implemented in the Ethereum test network (i.e. Rinkeby), which shows acceptable gas cost even the functions are called frequently.

In this paper, the problem of characterizing and controlling the AoI is studied in the context of blockchain-enabled monitoring networks (BeMN). In BeMN, status updates from sources are transmitted and recorded in a blockchain. To investigate the statistical characteristics of the AoI in BeMN, the transmission latency and the consensus latency are first rigorously modeled. Then, the average AoI, the AoI violation probability, and the peak AoI violation probability are derived in a closed form so as to quantify the performance of BeMN. Furthermore, a simplified form is derived for the AoI violation probability, and it is shown that this quantity can capture the upper or lower bound of the actual AoI violation probability. Simulation results show that each BeMN parameters (i.e., target successful transmission probability, block size, and timeout) can have conflicting effects on the AoI-related performance. Subsequently, design insights are provided to maintain the freshness of the status data in BeMN. Then, experimental results with a real Hyperledger Fabric platform further validate the accuracy of our modeling and analysis.

For a more specific example in food supply chains, end customers want to check the product information, but either doubt the authenticity of information, or simply do not have access to the information. The reason is that upstream suppliers and downstream retailers are often reluctant to share data, fearing privacy loss or business secret leakage. The consequence is that regulatory departments may face enormous challenges to identify accurate contamination sources, if there is scarce information or falsely recorded information at any stage of the food supply chain. In this paper, we focus on four common scenarios demanding information credibility in the agricultural supply chain: product traceability, E-commerce platforms, agricultural insurance, and agricultural financing. We review some high-profile smart credibility applications with emphasis on how blockchain related technologies can provide the information credibility by examining extant issues and relevant frameworks.

Recently, decentralized protocols with greater availability appear as well as blockchain-based attestation methods, allowing for proving the existence of information. In combination, these methods promise a secure, decentralized and long-term storage. However, there exist two major problems: (1) the scalability of blockchains limits their storage capacity and (2) various (de)centralized web protocols are in use and could alleviate this problem, but they do not support blockchain-based attestations. In this paper, we extend an approach for blockchain-based attestation with compatibility for multi-protocol storage. Instead of specific protocols or blockchains, the extended approach aims to contribute novel concepts to the discussion on blockchain scalability. It augments the capabilities of existing protocols for applications such as certification or timestamping of digital artifacts. With the use of decentralized protocols such as IPFS, further availability and inherent resilience properties are gained, allowing for applications such as open research repositories and digital registries. We discuss the architecture of the extended approach, a possible implementation in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain with IPFS and Git, and evaluate the time and cost of attestations. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; decentralized identifiers; distributed file systems; distributed information systems; internet protocolsDistributed computer systems; File organization; Information use; Internet protocols; Scalability; Block-chain; Client-server models; Decentralised; Decentralized identifier; Decentralized protocols; Distributed file systems; Distributed information systems; Long-term storage; Multiprotocols; Web protocols; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

The Industrial Internet of Things includes industrial applications such as robots, medical devices, and software-defined manufacturing processes. In terms of energy conservation, routing is extremely essential. The creation of an energy effectual steering procedure leads to a substantial rise in energy consumption. To minimize network traffic and increase network life, the article presented an Industrial IoT Fuzzy Logic Energy-Aware Routing Protocol (FLEA-RPL), which decreases network traffic as well as improves network life. The most suitable parent for data transfer is selected based on, among other things, the routing parameters charge, residual energy, and expected transmission count. Since the load routing metric is taken into consideration during the construction of the route, the data traffic is spread across the network. This increases network's lifetime while maintaining a high packet delivery ratio. The proposed work proposes a Multilayer Energy-Aware Aware RPL (MCEA-RPL) cluster for the Internet of Things to decrease network data traffic while increasing the lifetime of the network. It is split into three phases, each including the creation of network rings, intraring divisions, and intercluster routing. First and foremost, the virtual ring is created in the network. Secondly, each ring forms an identical cluster and chooses the CH node. Finally, it is responsible for the maintenance and performance of the DODAG. Data transfer from the lesser sheet to the DODAG root is known as data transfer. By using Blockchain technology, the lifetime of a network may be extended by reducing the number of identical data package transfers. This article offers Enhanced Mobility Support RPL (EM-RPL) in Industrial IoT which enhances mobility support with blockchain and spreads system generation. It comprises two processes: a collection of the parental static node and selection of the parent moving node. The static parent selection method uses routing metrics load and residual energy to identify the parent that is most suited for data transfer. Two phases of mobile parent selection must be distinguished: data transmission and route rediscovery. The mobile node utilizes furious logic to compute the hand-off value of the metric packet errors ratio and the signal strength indication received from the base station. If the hand-off value exceeds the threshold limit, the DODAG route has to be changed to work correctly. The EM-RPL thus increases the package delivery rate by reducing the amount of route interruption caused by mobility, while offering an efficient handling mechanism. © 2022 Abolfazl Mehbodniya et al.","Application programs; Blockchain; Computer circuits; Data transfer; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Block-chain; Data traffic; Energy aware routing protocols; Fuzzy-Logic; Mobility supports; Network lives; Network traffic; Residual energy; Routing metrics; Routings; Energy utilization","非CCF推荐");

It also provides the customers with excellent cloud access to various providers' wide range of financial services. The storage of such sensitive services and data on cloud servers is a double-edged sword. It can ease and support fine-grained access to such services/data anywhere and anytime, supporting the open banking system. But, on the other hand, data privacy and secrecy are a challenge. Thus, efficient access control should exist for open banking's services and data to protect cloud-hosted financial sensitive data from unauthorized customers. This paper proposes a new access control scheme that employs blockchain for the key-revocation process. We implement the smart contract's functions on the Ethereum platform and test the contract's code on the Kovan Testnet before deploying it to the Mainnet. Although the customer is authenticated to open banking, his key/s can be revoked according to the status response of the bank branch. Thus, his access to financial services and data is denied. We did comprehensive experiments for the revocation status response time, data exchanged until receiving the revocation status, and the time spent updating the policy. Also, we compared the results of our proposed scheme with two well-known methods - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). The experimental results show that our proposed scheme (BKR-AC) has a faster response time than Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in case of nonrevoked keys/certificates and a slower response time in case of revoked keys to avoid nonrevoking a revoked key. But the data exchanged is an average for BKR-AC between CRL and OCSP, which is still a tiny amount and accepted. The security analysis proved that our scheme is secure against some well-known attacks on open banking systems. In addition, it is also secured against the chosen-text attack by employing the challenge-response authentication mechanism. © 2022 Khaled Riad and Mohamed Elhoseny.","Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Finance; Online systems; Sales; Banking systems; Block-chain; Certificate revocation list; Cloud servers; Financial data; Financial sectors; Financial service; Key revocation; Online certificate status protocol; Revocation status; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

A landmark security property of smart contracts is liquidity: in a non-liquid contract, it may happen that some assets remain frozen, i.e. not redeemable by anyone. The relevance of this issue is witnessed by recent liquidity attacks to Ethereum, which have frozen hundreds of USD millions. We address the problem of verifying liquidity on BitML, a DSL for smart contracts with a secure compiler to Bitcoin, featuring primitives for currency transfers, contract renegotiation and consensual recursion. Our main result is a verification technique for liquidity. We first transform the infinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on the behaviour of a chosen set of contracts, abstracting from the moves of the context. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound, i.e. if the abstracted contract is liquid, then also the concrete one is such. We then verify liquidity by model-checking the finite-state abstraction. We implement a toolchain that automatically verifies liquidity of BitML contracts and compiles them to Bitcoin, and we assess it through a benchmark of representative contracts. © M. Bartoletti, S.

Current popular PoW protocols are based on hash puzzles. These puzzles are solved via a brute force search for a hash output with particular properties, such as a certain number of leading zeros. By considering the hash as a random function, and fixing a priori a sufficiently large search space, Grover’s search algorithm gives an asymptotic quadratic advantage to quantum machines over classical machines. In this paper, as a step towards a fuller understanding of post quantum blockchains, we propose a PoW protocol for which quantum machines have a smaller asymptotic advantage. Specifically, for a lattice of rank n sampled from a particular class, our protocol provides as the PoW an instance of the Hermite Shortest Vector Problem (Hermite-SVP) in the Euclidean norm, with a small approximation factor.

In such a system design, optimal signal control depends on dynamic traffic situation awareness via connected vehicles. Unfortunately, I-SIG suffers data spoofing from any hacked vehicle; in particular, the spoofing of the last vehicle can break the system and cause severe traffic congestion. Specifically, coordinated attacks on multiple intersections may even bring cascading failure of the road traffic network. To mitigate this security issue, a blockchainbased multi-intersection joint defense mechanism upon COP planning is designed. The major contributions of this paper are the following. 1) A blockchain network constituted by road-side units at multiple intersections, which are originally distributed and decentralized, is proposed to obtain accurate and reliable spoofing detection. 2) COP-oriented smart contract is implemented and utilized to ensure the credibility of spoofing vehicle detection. Thus, an I-SIG can automatically execute a signal planning scheme according to traffic information without spoofing data. Security analysis for the data spoofing attack is carried out to demonstrate the security.

For practicality reasons though, decryption requires the use of precomputed discrete-log (dlog) lookup tables along with algorithms like Shanks’s baby-step giant-step and Pollard’s kangaroo. We extend the Shanks approach as it is the most commonly used method in practice due to its determinism and simplicity, by proposing a truncated lookup table strategy to speed up decryption and reduce memory requirements. While there is significant overhead at the precomputation phase, these costs can be parallelized and only paid once and for all. As a starting point, we evaluated our solution against the widely-used secp family of elliptic curves and show that we can achieve storage reduction by 7x–14x, depending on the group size.

As of September 2021, the storage size of the Bitcoin blockchain has expanded to 355 GB, and it has increased by approximately 50 GB every year over the last five years. This storage requirement is a major hurdle to becoming a block proposer or validator. We propose an architecture called Trail that allows nodes to hold all blocks in a small storage and to generate and validate blocks and transactions. A node in Trail holds all blocks without transactions, UTXOs or account balances. The block size is approximately 8 kB, which is 100 times smaller than that of Bitcoin. On the other hand, a client who issues transactions needs to hold proof of its assets. Thus, compared to traditional blockchains, clients must store additional data. We show that proper data archiving can keep the account device storage size small. Then, we propose a method of executing smart contracts in Trail using a threshold signature. Trail allows more users to be block proposers and validators and improves the decentralization and security of the blockchain. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Accumulator; Blockchain; Storage consumptionBitcoin; Digital storage; Smart contract; Account balance; Accumulator; Additional datum; Block sizes; Block-chain; Data archiving; Decentralisation; Storage consumption; Storage requirements; Threshold signature; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

The immensity of the Cloud data makes it difficult to be thoroughly searched as required for forensic investigation. Securing the integrity of digital evidence in the hands of its custodians is also important. These problems and other challenges peculiar to the Cloud call for effective solutions. Forensic readiness is used to maximize the ability to collect digital evidence and minimize the cost of forensic during an incident response investigation.

A sharded blockchain divides consensus nodes (validators) into groups called shards and processes transactions separately to improve throughput and latency. In this paper, we analyze the rational behavior of users in account/balance model-based sharded blockchains and identify a phenomenon in which accounts (users’ wallets and smart contracts) eventually get concentrated in a few shards, making shard loads unfair. This phenomenon leads to bad user experiences, such as delays in transaction inclusions and increased transaction fees. To solve this problem, we propose two load balancing methods in account/balance model-based sharded blockchains. Both methods perform load balancing by periodically reassigning accounts: in the first method, the blockchain protocol itself performs load balancing and in the second method, wallets perform load balancing. We discuss the pros and cons of the two protocols, and apply the protocols to the execution sharding in Ethereum 2.0, an existing sharding design. Further, we analyze by simulation how the protocols behave to confirm that we can observe smaller transaction delays and fees. As a result, we released the simulation program as “Shargri-La,” a simulator designed for general-purpose user behavior analysis on the execution sharding in Ethereum 2.0. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers","Blockchain; Game theory; Heuristics; Load balancing; Sharding; Simulated annealingBehavioral research; Blockchain; Ethereum; Simulated annealing; Account balance; Balance model; Block-chain; Heuristic; Load-Balancing; Model-based OPC; Rational behaviours; Scalability problems; Sharding; Users' experiences; Game theory","非CCF推荐");

With asymmetric trust, in particular, a process is free to choose which other processes it trusts and which ones might collude against it. Cachin and Tackmann (OPODIS 2019) introduced asymmetric quorum systems as a generalization of Byzantine quorum systems, which are the key abstraction for realizing consensus in a system with symmetric trust.

Security and privacy technologies are related to mechanisms such as cryptography or authentication protocols that have been extensively explored and adapted to IoT requirements. However, new risks such as cyber-physical attacks and novel distributed, and pervasive architectures reveal new weaknesses where trust and reputation issues are the main challenges to be addressed. Nevertheless, both, trust and reputation, are intrinsically subjective and distributed, and algorithms guaranteeing a dynamic and efficient management of these properties tend to be computationally heavy and complex. In this context, new trust and reputation services for pervasive IoT deployments are needed. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new distributed architecture for the provision of trust and reputation services in IoT systems.

With society’s development, the education system is complicated, and the result of education evaluation becomes more and more critical to students. The evaluation process of education must be justice and transparent. In recent years, the Onscreen Marking (OSM) system based on traditional cloud platforms has been widely used in various large-scale public examinations. However, due to the excessive concentration of power in the existing scheme, the mainstream marking process is not transparent, and there are hidden dangers of black-box operation, which will damage the fairness of the examination. In addition, issues related to data security and privacy are still considered to be severe challenges. This paper deals with the above problems by providing secure and private transactions in a distributed OSM assuming the semi-trusted examination center. We have implemented a proof-of-concept for a consortium blockchain-based OSM in a privacy-preserving and auditable manner, enabling markers to mark on the distributed ledger anonymously.

However, due to validator-oriented voting, voting results are likely to be false when the number of validators with wrong votes increases. In the PoS protocol, validators are motivated to vote correctly by reward and penalty mechanisms. With such mechanisms, validators who contribute to correct consensuses are rewarded, while those who vote incorrectly are penalized. In this paper, we consider an incentivization mechanism based on the voting profile of a validator, which is estimated from the voting history of the validator. In this mechanism, the stake collected due to the penalties are redistributed to validators who vote correctly, improving the incentive of validators to contribute to the system. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism by computer simulations, investigating the impacts of system parameters on the estimation accuracy of the validator profile and the amount of validator’s stake. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanism can estimate the voting profile of a validator accurately even when the voting profile dynamically changes. It is also shown that the proposed mechanism gives more reward to validators who vote correctly with high voting profile. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers","Blockchain; Incentivization mechanism; Proof-of-stake; ReliabilityBlock-chain; Consensus algorithms; Incentivization mechanism; Mechanism-based; Penalty mechanism; Performance; Proof-of-stake; Reward and penalty; Systems parameters; Voting results; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Rather than traditional schemes, using smart contracts as a medium is a better choice for both participants, as it is fairer, more reliable, more efficient, and enables real-time payment. However, medical insurance contracts need to input the patient’s condition information as the judgment logic to trigger subsequent execution. Since the blockchain is a closed network, it lacks a secure network environment for data interaction with the outside world. The Data feed aims to provide the service of the on-chain and off-chain data interaction. Existing researches on the data feed has solved the security problems on it effectively, such as Town Crier, TLS-N and they have also taken into account the privacy-preserving problems. However, these schemes cannot actually protect privacy because when the ciphertext data is executed by the contract, privacy information can still be inferred by analyzing the transaction results, since states of the contract are publicly visible. In this paper, based on zero-knowledge proof and Hawk technology, a on-and-off-chain complete smart contract data feed privacy-preserving scheme is proposed. In order to present our scheme more intuitively, we combined the medical insurance compensation case to implement it, which is called MIPDF. In our MIPDF, the patient and the insurance company are parties involved in the contract, and the hospital is the data provider of data feed. The patient’s medical data is sent to the smart contract under the umbrella of the zero-knowledge proof signature scheme. The smart contract verifies the proof and calculates the insurance premium based on the judgment logic. Meanwhile, we use Hawk technology to ensure the privacy of on-chain contract execution, so that no information will be disclosed due to the result of contract execution. We give a general description of our scheme within the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We experiment and evaluate MIPDF on Ethereum for in-depth analysis. The results show that our scheme can securely and efficiently support the functions of medical insurance and achieve complete privacy-preserving. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers","Data feed; Medical Insurance; Privacy-preserving; Smart contractComputer circuits; Electronic data interchange; Insurance; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Condition; Contract execution; Data feed; Data interactions; Insurance contracts; Medical insurance; Privacy preserving; Real- time; Zero-knowledge proofs; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

In addition to the primary authentication between user equipment and the mobile operator network, secondary authentication between the user and Data Networks owned by the application is introduced in the 5G system. However, the implementation of secondary authentication introduces some challenges to application providers, not only the cost but also the capability, which leaves space for improving. In this paper, we designed an authentication mechanism for applications based on blockchain. With this mechanism, mobile operators and the application providers are able to share authentication related information like authentication results, users’ identification, users’ attribute information, users’ reputation and users’ blacklists, etc. securely. As a result, some application providers could execute user access control without deploying their own authentication systems any more. In addition with the shared comprehensive user information, mobile operators and application providers can make more fine and intelligent user access control. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Data sharing; User access control; User authentication5G mobile communication systems; Blockchain; Application providers; Authentication mechanisms; Authentication scheme; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Mobile applications; Mobile operators; Security features; User access control; User authentication; Authentication","非CCF推荐");

Based on these studies, this paper analyzes the Bitcoin blockchain in the period where Mt.Gox was active. We model the transactions in the blockchain as a graph and evaluate the degree centrality of each node. We thus analyze how the ranking of nodes with the highest centrality values changes over time. Our conclusions indicate that top nodes are stable, but there is a period where it changes. To better understand this behavior, we simulate the insertion of transactions in the network and verify how the ranking changes. As a result, we provide indications that we can use ranking changes to detect malicious activities.

As the first gateway of a certain mobile internet system, access authentication is an essential step that guarantees the internal security of the network. However, there are some problems in traditional cryptosystem-based authentication mechanisms, such as certificate management problem and centralized key escrow problem. Centralized storage of user information is restricted by the server, the security of the server is not within the user’s control, the stability of the server cannot be guaranteed, and personal privacy on the server may be leaked. In this paper, we focus on the private key escrow problem caused by the Private Key Generator (PKG) in Identity-Based Cryptosystems (IBC) mechanism and propose a Blockchain-assisted user public-private key generation scheme (BAKG) which introduces the blockchain to improve the robustness and reliability of key management. In BAKG, the user’s private key is determined by itself through combining the partial private keys from different PKGs, which prevents the risk of private key exposure caused by a single PKG. Meanwhile, based on the theory of the Combined Public Key (CPK) algorithm, we have designed a feasible blockchain-based key generation logic and developed a prototype authentication system based on the above concept. We further analyze the security of BAKG and the analytical results show that BAKG can meet various security requirements. In addition, according to the performance evaluation results, BAKG has good performance in both read/write consensus and different key length calculations, which means it has good potential for lightweight authentication applications. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Authentication; Blockchain; Combine public key; Identity-Based CryptosystemsBlockchain; Computation theory; Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Network security; Public key cryptography; Block-chain; Centralised; Combine public key; Escrow problem; Identity-based cryptosystem; Key escrow; Key generation; Private key; Public keys; Public-private; Authentication","非CCF推荐");

The use cases of blockchain are expanding beyond cryptocurrency management. In particular, the token economy, in which tokenized assets are exchanged across different blockchain ledgers, is gaining popularity. Cross-chain technologies such as atomic swap have emerged as security technologies to realize this new use case of blockchain. However, existing approaches of cross-chain technology have unresolved issues, such as application limitations on different blockchain platforms owing to the incompatibility of the communication interface and crypto algorithm and inability to handle a complex business logic such as the escrow trade. In this study, the ConnectionChain is proposed, which enables the execution of an extended smart contract using abstracted operation on interworking ledgers.

Data-driven marketing allows services to use a unique identifier to track each individual and deliver customized content. If a third party has gained unauthorized access to the behavioral data, the user’s privacy will be violated. Industry giants like Apple and Google are continuously working on user anonymity: they changed unique device identifiers to advertising ID and now manage to phase out advertising ID. At the same time, service providers and advertisers are also seeking better identity strategies. This paper mainly focuses on cross-app advertising and proposes a smart contract based personal data protection framework. Leveraging the smart contract’s advantages, we ensure transparency, tamper-resistance, and traceability during data storing and data sharing. In this framework, the user interacts with other entities anonymously, thus preventing identity leakage. In addition, we introduce a reward mechanism that allows users who authorize data sharing to be paid by the service. We then implement the proposed framework on Etherum combined with the IPFS to validate our design.

The collected data are usually linked with sensitive information, raising the concerns of user privacy leakage. To date, many approaches have been proposed to protect the users’ privacy, with the majority relying on a centralized structure, which poses though attack and intrusion vulnerability. Some studies build a distributed platform exploiting a blockchain-type solution, which still requires a fully trusted third party (TTP) to manage a reliable reward distribution in the MCS. Spurred by the deficiencies of current methods, we propose a distributed user privacy protection structure that combines blockchain and a trusted execution environment (TEE). The proposed architecture successfully manages the users’ privacy protection and an accurate reward distribution without requiring a TTP. This is because the encryption algorithms ensure data confidentiality and uncouple the correlation between the users’ identity and the sensitive information in the collected data. Accordingly, the smart contract signature is used to manage the user deposit and verify the data.

In this work we study Virtual ASICs–a generalization of proof-of-stake. Virtual ASICs are essentially a virtualized version of proof-of-work. Miners can buy on-chain virtual mining machines which can be powered by virtual electricity. Similar to their physical counterparts, each powered virtual ASIC has a certain chance to win the right to create the next block. In the boundary case where virtual electricity is free, the protocol corresponds to proof-of-stake using an ASIC token which is separate from the currency itself (the amount of stake equals your virtual computing power). In the other boundary case where virtual computers are free, we get a proof-of-burn equivalent. That is, a consensus mechanism in which miners ‘burn’ currency to obtain lottery tickets for the right to create the next block. From a technical point of view, we provide the following contributions: We design cryptographic protocols that allow to sell Virtual ASICs in sealed-bid auctions on-chain. We ensure that as long as a majority of the miners in the system mine honestly, bids remain both private and binding, and that miners cannot censor the bids of their competitors;In order to implement our auction protocol, we introduce a novel all-or-nothing broadcast functionality in blockchains that allows to “encrypt values to the future” and could be of independent interest.Finally, we provide a consensus protocol based on Virtual ASICs by generalizing existing protocols for proof-of-stake consensus. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Application specific integrated circuits; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptography; Distributed ledger; Energy utilization; Computing power; Consensus protocols; Cryptographic protocols; Energy; Energy-consumption; Generalisation; Mining machines; Proof of work; Virtual computing; Virtual electricities; Miners","非CCF推荐");

Alliance chain is mainly used to query and share product traceability information. The private chain will be used to collect and store the product traceability information of each enterprise and then connected to the alliance chain via hash pointers. The proposed system is beneficial for reducing the burden of network transmission of alliance chain and improving the efficiency of consumer product data query. At the same time, the private chain ensures the security and privacy of enterprise product data, which not only has high data storage efficiency but also can meet the requirements of all participants for the traceability system.

It plays an important role in healthcare, medical research and insurance sectors. The consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology for the selection of a new block, provide high-level of security to IoT devices. However, the reliability problem still exists. In the present paper, a blockchain based hybrid consensus mechanism (HCM) is implemented in electronic healthcare system (EHS) to overcome trustworthiness issues. The aim of the proposed HCM is to maintain reputation module on the basis of the block activities. In this context, EHS is designed in four layers namely: system layer, inter-network layer, blockchain layer, and cloud layer. Moreover, HCM consists of five algorithms for creation, validation, fork handling (if any), Merkle tree construction and reward/punishment module respectively. Dev C++ software platform is used for the simulation of the above mentioned HCM algorithms excluding Merkle tree construction which is simulated using conditional contrast high itemset tree. It is observed that all the blocks use same methodology to be the part of a new blockchain network. Moreover, the CPU and memory consumption in the implementation of HCM is always below two percent and about fifty percent respectively as shown in the latency graph. The basic security goal (confidentiality, integrity and availability) is guaranteed with the help of the height of the Merkel tree as well. The performances of the proposed HCM and Proof of X-repute (PoXR) blockchain consensus algorithms are compared with respect to various parameters such as final difficulty, reward and punishment provisions etc. HCM shows superior performance as the final earned reputation is calculated for each block along with the reward and punishment modules during the deployment of blockchain network. In addition, a simple concept of Merkle-tree is opted for providing reward and punishment rather than a set of complex mathematical equations as used in PoXR consensus algorithm. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","Blockchain; Consensus; Electronic healthcare system (EHS); Punishment; Reputation; Reward","非CCF推荐");

First, the related theories and methods of microgrid systems, wireless power transmission, and deep learning optimization based on blockchain technology are introduced. Next, the microgrid economic dispatch is simulated and analyzed on a large scale. Finally, the comparison results between microgrid economic dispatch and common radio energy transmission technologies are analyzed. The results show that daily planning can better coordinate the state of distributed generation, energy storage system, and public connection. The operation results of the previous day correspond to the long-term operation economy of the microgrid. The total operation cost of the microgrid is 4668 yuan/day, and the remaining power is maintained between 500 and 600 kW, which helps to prevent excessive battery discharge, prolong battery life, and reduce operation cost. The simulation results show that the total power imbalance of the microgrid can reduce the output fluctuation of controllable load shedding of distributed generation. When the load characteristics are not important, the output fluctuation of controllable distributed generation can be reduced.

However, these methods cannot discover the source of typical behaviours, such as the malicious applications in the blockchain environment. Android application is an important part of the blockchain operating environment, and machine learning-based Android malware application detection method is significant for blockchain user security. The way of constructing features in these methods determines the performance. The single-feature mechanism, training classifiers with one type of features, cannot detect the malicious applications effectively which exhibit the typical behaviours in various forms. The multifeatures fusion mechanism, constructing mixed features from multiple types of data sources, can cover more kinds of information. However, different types of data sources will interfere with each other in the mixed features constructed by this mechanism. That limits the performance of the model. In order to improve the detection performance of Android malicious applications in complex scenarios, we propose an Android malicious application detection method which includes parallel feature processing and decision mechanism. Our method uses RGB image visualization technology to construct three types of RGB image which are utilized to train different classifiers, respectively, and a decision mechanism is designed to fuse the outputs of subclassifiers through weight analysis. This approach simultaneously extracts different types of features, which preserve application information comprehensively. Different classifiers are trained by these features to guarantee independence of each feature and classifier.

Tracing the origins of a rice product from rawmaterials to end customers is very complex and costly. Existing food supply chainmethods (for example, rice) do not provide a scalable and cost-effective means ofagricultural food supply. Besides, consumers lack the capability and resourcesrequired to check or report on the quality of agricultural goods in terms of defects orcontamination. Consequently, customers are forced to decide whether to utilize ordiscard the goods.

The aim of this paper is to propose a framework capable oftracking and monitoring all interactions and transactions between all stakeholdersin the rice chain ecosystem through smart contracts. The model incorporates asystem for customer satisfaction feedback, which enables all stakeholders to getup-to-date information on product quality, enabling them to make more informedsupply chain decisions.

This growth brings up several challenging issues for a successful continuous operation of IoT applications. Some of these challenges that need to be taken care of are resource constraints, central server overload, and the risk of illegal use of private data. On the other side, Blockchain technology is increasingly popular and has gained huge success in cryptocurrencies. It offers numerous vital qualities such as a technique for consensus, peer communications, confidence-building without a trustworthy third party, and a transaction controlled by conditions and functions using the intelligent contract technique. Blockchain is an excellent candidate to establish a decentralized, autonomous IoT system addressing the above issues. This study proposes an IoT-Blockchain integration architecture using an Ethereum Blockchain infrastructure within a rich-thin client IoT approach to address the challenges created by the limited IoT resources while implementing the Blockchain mining technique in IoT systems. The architecture depends on load distribution between the resources. Limited resource devices are the thin-clients, while the higher resource devices are assigned as rich-clients. Both clients can access the blockchain and collect the data, but rich-client can only execute the mining process. In addition, we implement a healthcare system based on the proposed architecture in which surgical process management is carried out. We also prove our solution's efficiency by testing and comparing the architecture against other well-known IoT-based blockchain architectures. The obtained results show that proposed blockchain-IoT architecture is suited for many IoT applications while avoiding difficulties created by IoT devices' limitations. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; Ethereum; healthcare; Internet of Things (IoT)Bitcoin; Blockchain; Ethereum; Health care; Internet of things; Block-chain; Central servers; Continuous operation; Internet of thing; Resource Constraint; Rich client; Security; Server overload; Thin clients; Computer architecture","非CCF推荐");

The communication technologies allow one IoT device to discover and communicate with another in order to exchange services, in a similar way to what humans do in their social networks. Knowing the reputation of another device is important to consider whether it is trustworthy before establishing a new connection and thus avoid possible unexpected behaviours as a consequence. Trustworthiness, as a property of a device, can be affected by different factors including its geographical location. Hence, this research work proposes an architecture to manage reputation values of end devices in an IoT system based on the area where they are located. A cloud-fog-edge architecture is proposed, where the fog layer uses the Blockchain technology to keep the reputation management system consistent and fault-tolerant across different nodes. The location-based part of the system was done by storing geographical areas in Smart Contracts (coined as Geospatial Smart Contracts) and making the reputation values subject to different regions depending on the geographical location of the device. To reduce the complexity of the spatial computation, the geographical data are geocoded by either one of two different spatial indexing techniques. This work also introduced two different structures for storing geocoded areas based on either cell-list or tree-structure. Finally, three experiments to test the proposed architecture are presented, to deploy the architecture in IoT devices, and to compare the two geocoding techniques in Smart Contracts.

However, existing data sharing systems for VANETs cannot provide selective data with sufficient privacy protection. Moreover, some schemes also cannot ensure stable data accessibility and the integrity of retrieved data. On the other hand, with the improvements such as lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth, 5G technology brings more possibilities to future applications. The join of the software-defined networks (SDNs) also offers efficient and effective network management.

The proposed scheme is designed to realize stable data accessibility by leveraging smart contracts and blockchain oracle.

It permits on-chain interactions to achieve trustworthy properties such as traceability, transparency, and accountability. However, current blockchain trustworthiness is only confined to on-chain, creating a &#x2018;`trust gap&#x2019;' to the physical, off-chain environment. This is due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world in a real-time and consistent manner. Such an absence hinders further blockchain applications in the physical world, especially for the security-sensitive ones. In this paper, we propose a framework to extend blockchain trust from on-chain to off-chain, and take trustworthy vaccine tracing as an example scheme. Our scheme consists of 1) a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-enabled trusted environment monitoring system built with the Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller that continuously senses the inside of a vaccine box through trusted sensors and generates anti-forgery data; and 2) a consistency protocol to upload the environment status data from the TEE system to blockchain in a truthful, real-time consistent, continuous and fault-tolerant fashion. Our security analysis indicates that no adversary can tamper with the vaccine in any way without being captured. Our experiment shows a small system latency of 84 ms.

As a result, digital evidence must be protected since it is complex, volatile, and susceptible to alteration. In the digital evidence method, the chain of custody (CoC) is essential. As a result of the CoC, it is possible to establish that the evidence was never tampered with. Due to the inherent uncertainty of digital evidence, the trustworthiness of the CoC cannot be judged at this time. It is the duty of forensic examiners to challenge this inclination and publicly admit the inherent ambiguity in whatever evidence they use to make their decisions. This article suggests a new paradigm for maintaining the integrity of digital evidence in order to overcome these challenges. To handle the uncertainty generated by error-prone technologies while dealing with CoC documents, the new paradigm used a fuzzy hash inside the blockchain data structure. Traditional hashing methods are only able to tell whether two inputs are precisely the same or not because they are sensitive to even the smallest input changes. Using fuzzy hash functions, we can figure out how dissimilar two images are by comparing their similarities. As an example of how this paradigm may be applied to computer systems and make digital investigations more successful, we utilize image forensics as the focus of an in-depth look at how it works. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; chain of custody; digital evidence; fuzzy hash; image forensicBlockchain; Chains; Computer crime; Crime; Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Image enhancement; Uncertainty analysis; Block-chain; Chain of custody; Digital evidence; Forgery; Fuzzy hash; Image forensics; License; Uncertainty; Hash functions","非CCF推荐");

Intelligence networking enables each CAV to train appropriate models locally to learn how to drive in different environments, which can make up for the lack of experience of single-vehicle. However, model training and intelligence networking consume a lot of energy, calling on high-energy-efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT)-based green intelligence networking scheme (NGIN) for CAVs in smart cities. We use NFT to tokenize and describe intelligence by metadata, enabling applications to network intelligence efficiently, thereby reducing energy consumption. We present the architecture, modules, and efficient mechanisms of distributed intelligence networking.

Blockchain has many attractive properties and is suitable for managing patient locations in telecare medical information systems (TMIS). Recently, Ji et al. proposed a blockchain-based multilevel privacy-preserving location sharing (BMPLS) scheme for TMIS. In this paper, we show that Ji et al.'s BMPLS scheme does not achieve confidentiality and multilevel privacy-preserving. An adversary outside the system can use an ordinary personal computer to completely break the system within a dozen hours and obtain the location of any patient at any time. The adversary inside the system can use an ordinary personal computer to obtain the location of the designated patient within tens of seconds. Using salting technology, we propose an improved BMPLS scheme to fix our attacks. We also optimized the BMLS scheme to make it correct and executable. The security analysis shows that the improved BMPLS scheme achieves decentralization, untamperability, confidentiality, multilevel privacy-preserving, retrievability, and verifiability.

However, during the construction and operation of 5G, telecom operators face many challenges, such as insufficient frequency resources, low efficiency of network management, information opacity, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Blockchain is a distributed system maintained by multiple parties with inherit features including decentralization, traceability and tamperproof. These features collectively contribute to a new application ecosystem where transactions are secure and trustworthy. Therefore, blockchain is expected to integrate with 5G networks to build safer and more reliable mobile network infrastructures.

By traffic event reporting, traffic efficiency can be significantly improved. However, people usually lack the motivation for reporting traffic events or driving violations, because once the identity of the reporter is leaked, he or she may be tracked by malicious attackers or be retaliated by violators. However, if the reporter is anonymous, it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy and authenticity of the reports. In order to solve this contradiction, a mechanism that combines certificateless message authentication and blockchain incentives is proposed in this paper. A certificateless message signature algorithm is designed to provide the anonymity and non-repudiation for traffic-related message reporters. Simultaneously, an adaptive t-threshold multi-signature mechanism is introduced in our scheme. Similar to crowdsourcing, it requires multiple participants to witness the authenticity of the message together. Aggregation signature verification improves message authentication efficiency.

However, for applications that transmit critical data, it is recommended to add some security measures. Many articles have used blockchain to improve security in the IoT environment; however, most of them neglect that many IoT systems are already functional. It is tough to rebuild the architecture from scratch. This article aims to propose a secured MQTT architecture using blockchain and smart contracts without affecting the overall operation of the MQTT protocol. Instead, it adds some parameters to the standard MQTT messages. The new architecture is based on blockchain and smart contract to control and store the transactions between clients and brokers. It is composed of two phases: The registration phase, where a client asks for a token to use for publishing or receiving data, and the Publishing phase, where the brokers network verifies the validity of the token and the integrity of the data before allowing the client publication. By comparing the current architecture and the improved one, we can conclude that the architecture proposed in this article will improve the security of MQTT protocol by using tokens for authentication, topic key for ensuring data confidentiality, brokers network to avoid a single point of failure and data hash to ensure the integrity of data.

Anonymous cryptocurrencies have been proposed to improve the privacy degree of DAP systems, such as Zerocash and Monero. However, the strong degree of privacy may cause new regulatory concerns, i.e., the anonymity of transactions can be used for illegal activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing. In this paper, we propose a novel DAP scheme that supports regulatory compliance and enforcement. We first introduce regulators into the system, who define regulatory policies for anonymous payment, and the policies are enforced through commitments and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for compostable statements. By which, users can prove that transactions are valid and comply with regulations. A tracing mechanism is embedded in the scheme to allow regulators to recover the real identities of users when suspicious transactions are detected. The formal security model and proof are provided to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve desired security properties, and the performance evaluation shows its high efficiency.

This paper studies the secure access control of smart home data combined with the blockchain technology and password technology to realize the secure and efficient access control of smart home data. The system can achieve the goal of independent research and development. Aiming at the problem that the access control of a smart home is generally managed by third-party authorized institutions and there is an unauthorized access, a blockchain-based smart home (BSH) access control scheme is proposed. The scheme extends the attribute-based access control model (ABAC) and applies the blockchain technology to the smart home ABAC model to realize fine-grained access control. In the scheme, the resource provider first publishes the access control policy of the resource to the blockchain. If the resource visitor wants to access the resource, he needs to submit an access request to the blockchain and use an SM2 threshold signature to process the transaction proposal. The endorsement peer node in the blockchain runs the access control policy smart contract to decide whether to grant access rights. This scheme can ensure that resource providers can participate in all the processes of access control and avoid the risk of unauthorized access caused by the centralized management of the third party. Finally, the simulation experiment is carried out on the Hyperledger Fabric alliance chain development platform. The results show that the BSH access control scheme has good applicability in the smart home scenario. © 2022 Kun Liao.","Access control; Automation; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Information management; Process control; Simulation platform; Access control models; Access control policies; Access control schemes; Attribute based access control; Block-chain; Cloud services; Resource providers; Smart homes; Third parties; Unauthorized access; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Healthcare participants can make accurate diagnosis, treatment and research based on the shared Personal Health Records (PHRs) sensed from remote H-IOT devices. However, current H- IOT systems fall short of a secure and trustworthy PHR sharing service in remote healthcare, which is able to prevent user privacy leakage and PHR violation together with high efficiency in key distribution apart from supporting efficient data retrieval and fine-grained access control. In response, we present a blockchain- based hierarchical data sharing framework (BHDSF) to provide fine-grained access control and efficient retrieval over encrypted PHRs with low consumed hierarchical key distribution and key leakage resistance. Compared with existing solutions, BHDSF takes untrusted cloud and malicious auditor into consideration simultaneously, and achieves trustworthy PHR integrity auditing and metadata verification by leveraging blockchain technique. Besides, BHDSF enables efficiently aggregative authentication for source records from H-IoT devices, which is lacked in most of existing data sharing frameworks.

The blockchain is used to register the nodes and store the data packets' transactions. Moreover, the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used in the model to avoid the extra overhead incurred due to the use of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Furthermore, during routing of data packets, malicious nodes can exist in the IoST network, which eavesdrop the communication. Therefore, the Genetic Algorithm-based Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) and Genetic Algorithm-based Decision Tree (GA-DT) models are proposed for malicious node detection. After the malicious node detection, the Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the optimal routing path in the network. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model. PoA is compared with PoW in terms of the transaction cost in which PoA has consumed 30% less cost than PoW. Furthermore, without Man In The Middle (MITM) attack, GA-SVM consumes 10% less energy than with MITM attack. Moreover, without any attack, GA-SVM consumes 30% less than grayhole attack and 60% less energy than mistreatment. The results of Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), GA-DT, and GA-SVM are compared in terms of accuracy and precision. The accuracy of DT, SVM, GA-DT, and GA-SVM is 88%, 93%, 96%, and 98%, respectively. The precision of DT, SVM, GA-DT, and GA-SVM is 100%, 92%, 94%, and 96%, respectively. In addition, the Dijkstra algorithm is compared with Bellman Ford algorithm. The shortest distances calculated by Dijkstra and Bellman are 8 and 11 hops long, respectively. Also, security analysis is performed to check the smart contract's effectiveness against attacks. Moreover, we induced three attacks: grayhole attack, mistreatment attack, and MITM attack to check the resilience of our proposed system model. © 2022 Maimoona Bint E.

As a result of the potential privacy and security challenges in the distributed energy system, it is becoming a great problem to optimally schedule EVs' charging with different energy consumption patterns and perform reliable energy trading in the SC. In this paper, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving energy trading system for 5G-deployed SC is proposed. The proposed system is divided into two components: EVs and residential prosumers. In this system, a reputation-based distributed matching algorithm for EVs and a Reward-based Starvation Free Energy Allocation Policy (RSFEAP) for residential homes are presented. A short-term load forecasting model for EVs' charging using multiple linear regression is proposed to plan and manage the intermittent charging behavior of EVs. In the proposed system, identity-based encryption and homomorphic encryption techniques are integrated to protect the privacy of transactions and users, respectively. The performance of the proposed system for EVs' component is evaluated using convergence duration, forecasting accuracy, and executional and transactional costs as performance metrics. For the residential prosumers' component, the performance is evaluated using reward index, type of transactions, energy contributed, average convergence time, and the number of iterations as performance metrics. The simulation results for EVs' charging forecasting gives an accuracy of 99.25%. For the EVs matching algorithm, the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm converges faster than the bichromatic mutual nearest neighbor algorithm. For RSFEAP, the number of iterations for 50 prosumers is 8, which is smaller than the benchmark. Its convergence duration is also 10 times less than the benchmark scheme. Moreover, security and privacy analyses are presented.

At the same time, in the power Internet of Things environment, reliable data is essential for data use and accurate analysis. Data security has become a key factor in ensuring the stable operation of the power grid. However, the power Internet of Things devices is extremely vulnerable to network attacks, leading to data tampering and deletion. Resisting tampering, preventing data loss, and reliably restoring data have become difficult to ensure data security. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a trusted data recovery system based on blockchain and coding technology. Data nodes of the power Internet of Things encode key data and back them up to the blockchain network through a data processing server located on the edge. The data processing server performs real-time detection of the data integrity of the data nodes. When the data is tampered with or deleted, the data processing server promptly obtains the corresponding data encoding blocks from the blockchain network, decodes them, and sends them to the data node to complete the data recovery task. According to the test result, the data backup speed of this system is increased by 15.3%, and the data recovery speed is increased by 19.8% compared with the traditional scheme. It has good security and real-time performance. Meanwhile, it reduces the network and storage resource overhead in the data backup and recovery process. © 2022 Jinqian Chen et al.","Blockchain; Computer system recovery; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Encoding (symbols); Network security; Recovery; Accurate analysis; Block-chain; Coding techniques; Continuous development; Data backups; Data recovery; Key factors; Power; Stable operation; Uses analysis; Internet of things","非CCF推荐");

The existing challenges include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edgeservers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional PKI-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end which largely motivates us to institute a Blockchain and AI aligned APT detection system. The unique contributions of the paper include efficient APT detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boost trust among collaborators and ensure an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority.

The research was carried out by using the method of description, literature analysis, and research conducted. The study investigates the empirical verification of the efficacy of investment diversification using the main stock exchange indices in the Eurozone countries and Bitcoin. The aim of the research is to examine whether it is justified and to what extent to include Bitcoin in the portfolio of an institutional investor. The analysis includes data on the daily movement of selected action indices as well as the movement of Bitcoin. The methodology involves the analysis of high-frequency data, given that daily trading data were used. The results show that it is justified to include Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in the portfolio structure. Also, the results show which share of Bitcoin in the portfolio is justified from the aspect of institutional investors. The data used in the analysis cover the period from 2020. The results of the research show that Bitcoin is a good source of diversification in a portfolio that contains traditional financial instruments, both for an investor who is not prone to risk, and for those investors who have a greater appetite for risk.

We study the problem of round-complexity of zero-knowledge, and more broadly, of secure computation in the blockchain-hybrid model, where all parties can access the blockchain as an oracle. We study zero-knowledge and secure computation through the lens of a new security notion where the simulator is given the ability to “time-travel” or more accurately, to look into the future states of the blockchain and use this information to perform simulation. Such a time-traveling simulator gives a novel security guarantee of the following form: whatever the adversary could have learnt from an interaction, it could have computed on its own shortly into the future (e.g., a few hours from now). We exhibit the power of time-traveling simulators by constructing round-efficient protocols in the blockchain-hybrid model. In particular, we construct: 1. Three-round zero-knowledge (ZK) argument for NP with a polynomial-time black-box time-traveling simulator. 2. Three-round secure two-party computation (2PC) for any functionality with a polynomial-time black-box time-traveling simulator for both parties. In addition to standard cryptographic assumptions, we rely on natural hardness assumptions for Proof-of-Work based blockchains. In comparison, in the plain model, three-round protocols with black-box simulation are impossible, and constructions with non-black-box simulation for ZK require novel cryptographic assumptions while no construction for three-round 2PC is known. Our three-round 2PC result relies on a new, two-round extractable commitment that admits a time-traveling extractor. © Vipul Goyal, Justin Raizes, and Pratik Soni; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0","Blockchain; Cryptography; Secure two-party computation; Zero knowledgeCryptography; Polynomial approximation; Simulators; Black boxes; Black-box simulation; Block-chain; Cryptographic assumptions; Hybrid model; Polynomial-time; Round complexity; Secure computation; Secure two-party computations; Zero knowledge; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

In this paper, we propose a novel secure multi-controller rule enforcement verification (BlockREV) mechanism in SDN to guarantee the correctness of cross-domain forwarding. We first adopt blockchain technology to provide the immutability and privacy protection for forwarding behaviors. Furthermore, we present an address-based aggregate signature scheme with appropriate cryptographic primitives, which is provably secure in the random oracle model. Moreover, we design a verification algorithm based on hash values of forwarding paths to check the consistency of forwarding order.

In particular, we present two attacks. The first one, which we shall call a probing attack, enables an adversary to determine the (hidden) balance of a channel or route through active probing and differentiating the response messages from the route participants. The second one, which we shall call a timing attack, enables the adversary to determine the logical distance to the target in hops, given that geographical data of LN nodes is often publicly listed, or can be inferred from allocated IP addresses.

Recently, city authorities, transport logistic designers, and policymakers have tasked researchers/entrepreneurs to innovate in shared mobility systems. This paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Shared Mobility (BESM) architecture that allocates seats to residents/tourists in a shareable vehicle based on air quality and COVID-19 information of traveling locations. BESM involves smart city authorities, vehicle owners, hospital authorities, and residents using permissioned-blockchains to collaboratively decide on allocating travel seats. Experiments were carried out at the IoT Cloud research laboratory to manifest the allocation of seats. For instance, BESM excluded in allocating seats to asthma patients and limited the number of travelers in the cities where COVID-19 cases or pollution levels were higher in numbers using BESM. The pollution levels of cities were monitored using air quality monitoring sensors or predicted using a few prediction algorithms such as Random Forests (RF), Linear Regression (LR), Quantile Regression (QR), Ridge Regression (RR), Lasso Regression (LaR), ElasticNet Regression (ER), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recursive Partitioning (RP).

To achieve the maximum efficiency from the transportation system, the ideas of vehicle-to-subway (V2S) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) are utilized to develop a bilateral power flow strategy (charging/discharging or idle mode) to provide the chief charging requirements of energy systems.

The internet is smoothly changing from an internet of people towards an Internet of Things, which permits various objects to connect to another wirelessly. The energy consumption of the IoT routing protocol can affect the network life span. In addition, the high volume of data produced by IoT will result in transmission collision, security issues, and energy dissipation due to increased data redundancy because tiny sensors are usually hard to recharge after they are deployed. Generally, to save energy, data aggregation reduces data redundancy at each node by turning some nodes into sleep mode and others into wake mode. Therefore, it is important to group the nodes with high data similarity using the fuzzy matrix. Then, the data received from the member nodes at the Cluster Head (CH) are analyzed using a fuzzy similarity matrix for clustering. In the next step, after clustering, some nodes are chosen from all groups as redundant nodes. The sleep scheduling mechanism is then applied to reduce data redundancy, network traffic jamming, and transmission costs. We have proposed an Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation Mechanism (EEDAM) secured by blockchain, which uses a data aggregation mechanism at the cluster level to save energy. As edge computing is used to provide on-demand trusted services to IoT with minimum delay, blockchain is integrated inside a cloud server, so the edge is validated by the blockchain to provide secure services to IoT. Finally, we performed simulations to calculate the performance of the proposed mechanism and compared it with the conventional energy-efficient algorithms.

In addition to the high-performance and low-cost requirements, the hardware for SHA-2 must be highly flexible for many applications. This paper proposes an SHA-2 hardware architecture named the multimode SHA-2 accelerator (MSA), which has high performance and flexibility at the system-on-chip level. To achieve high performance and flexibility, our accelerator applies three optimal techniques. First, a multimode processing element architecture is proposed to enable the accelerator to compute various SHA-2 functions for many applications. Second, a three-stage arithmetic logic unit pipeline architecture is proposed to reduce the critical paths and hardware resources. Finally, nonce generator and nonce validator architectures are proposed to reduce memory access and maximize the performance of the proposed MSA for blockchain mining applications. The MSA accuracy is tested on a real hardware platform (the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA). The experimental results on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) prove that the proposed MSA achieves significantly better performance, hardware efficiency, and flexibility than previous works.

First, we configure IoT devices as light nodes and design a Sybil-resistant, unlinkable and supervisable distributed identity that does not rely on central identity providers.

It not only realizes the mutual communication of multiple independent blockchains, but also ensures the data consistency. However, existing crosschain technologies like notary mechanism, hash locking, distributed private key control, and sidechain/relaychain have potential vulnerabilities, resulting in different kinds of attacks. For example, some vulnerabilities that only exist in a blockchain like DDOS, overflow, double-spending, and so on, may have an impact on another secure blockchain due to the openness of the crosschain system. Even if all blockchains are safe enough, the security of the crosschain system cannot be guaranteed, and there are still many loopholes in the process of crosschain, which affect all blockchains. The security of crosschain has emerged as an important issue. In this work, based on BitXHub, an open-source project of crosschain, we are motivated to study the security of Fabric isomorphic crosschain system. First, we analyze the vulnerabilities in different layers of Fabric isomorphic crosschain systems, and discuss the principles of different kinds of attacks.

From immutable log ledger applications to authorisation systems applications, the current technological consensus implies that most of Internet problems could be effectively solved by deploying some form of blockchain environment. Regardless this 'consensus', there are decentralised Internet-based applications on which blockchain technology can actually solve several problems and improve the functionality of these applications. The development of these new blockchain-based solutions is grouped into a new paradigm called Blockchain 3.0 and its concepts go far beyond the well-known cryptocurrencies.

It builds a secure and robust system by generating a backup locally for each participant node to collectively maintain the network. However, this feature brings some privacy concerns since all nodes can access the chain data, users' sensitive information under risk of leakage. The local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism can be a promising way to address this issue as it implements data perturbation before uploading to the chain. While traditional LDP mechanisms cannot fit well with blockchain since the requirements of a fixed input range, large data volume, and using the same privacy budget, which are practically difficult in a decentralized environment. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel LDP mechanism to split input numerical data and implement perturbation by digital bits, which does not require a fixed input range and large data volume. In addition, we use an iteration approach to adaptively allocate the privacy budget for different perturbation procedures that minimize the total deviation of perturbed data and increase the data utility. We employ mean estimation as the statistical utility metric under the same and randomized privacy budgets to evaluate the performance of our novel LDP mechanism. The experiment results indicate that the proposed LDP mechanism performs better in different scenarios, and our adaptive privacy budget allocation model can significantly reduce the deviation of perturbation function to provide high data utility while maintaining privacy.

Secure cryptography created a niche for blockchain to provide alternatives to well-known security compromises. However, design bottlenecks with traditional blockchain data structures scale poorly with increased network usage and are extremely computation-intensive. This made the technology difficult to combine with limited devices, like those in Internet of Things networks. In protocols like IOTA, replacement of blockchain's linked-list queue processing with a lightweight dynamic ledger showed remarkable throughput performance increase. However, current stochastic algorithms for ledger construction suffer distinct trade-offs between efficiency and security. This work proposed a machine-learning approach with a multi-arm bandit that resolved these issues and was designed for auditing on limited devices. This algorithm was tested in a reinforcement-learning environment simulating the IOTA ledger's construction with a decision tree. This study showed through regret analysis and experimentation that this approach was secure against impulse manipulation attacks while remaining energy-efficient.

Data access control becomes more challenging because of intruders and malicious cloud servers. Most of the traditional approaches do not consider the issues in controlling user accessing cloud data storage and sharing. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption is one of the most effective techniques that provide secure data access control for sensitive data outsourced in cloud storage. However, in traditional cloud data sharing system, there are several issues regarding transaction traceability, user authorization, data ownership management and access control preservation. Also, traditional access control schemes do not have an effective method to compensate cloud users whose data integrity is lost.

However, these models are susceptible to procrastinating auditors who may not conduct the scheduled auditing on time. Therefore, this paper introduces a blockchain-based methodology to employ a certificateless public auditing model against malicious and procrastinating auditors with efficient user revocation to address these issues. It enables the storage of immutable time-stamped auditing results as a transaction on the blockchain. So, the users can verify whether TPA performs the auditing task on the scheduled time.

IoT network has many applications especially in smart city and smart campus. IoT devices usually produce a huge amount of data that are stored in the cloud to be analyzed later. Data in general and IoT devices data in particular suffer from major security issues such as the availability and the integrity of data. Blockchain is a new technology that offers an interesting solution for the security of sensitive IoT data by protecting data against malicious tampering. However, the data stored in the blockchain cannot be altered, therefore, it should be validated before being stored in the blockchain especially that IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks. Machine learning algorithms are very useful to detect compromised IoT devices to ensure that only reliable data are stored in the blockchain. The main aim of this paper is to propose a framework for storing reliable IoT data in a secure way that preserves the integrity and availability properties. First, to detect compromised IoT devices, several machine learning algorithms are evaluated. The IoTID20 dataset for anomalous activity detection in IoT network is used to build our machine learning model. IoTID20 dataset contains 80 network features and 625783 records. For our experiment, 4000 records are selected randomly from the dataset. Two algorithms are used to select features namely Logistic Regression and Pearson’s correlation. A total of 15 features are selected in order to classify packets as (Normal, Anomaly). Several machine learning algorithms are trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Naïve Bayes. These algorithms are compared based on the following measurements: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the time for classification. The results reveal that Random Forest and AdaBoost classifiers give very close results and are considered the best classifiers based on all performance metrics used in the paper except the time. Regarding the time required to detect malicious records, Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes are the best as the time required to predict 4000 records is 0.015 seconds. A private blockchain is built to store normal data received from IoT devices after being filtered. The data is signed and then distributed to all nodes in the network for verification. To provide scalability, the consensus algorithm of the blockchain is based on the proof of authority algorithm. As a proof of concepts, the blockchain is developed using Python programming language and the time required to verify the signatures is computed. © 2022 University of Bahrain.

Existing certificating systems are marked by their lack of speed and low reliability and, in certain education systems, they produce social and cultural conflicts. Therefore, this paper offers an analysis of blockchain adoption in this field, focusing especially on the process of producing and sharing higher education certificates. The paper describes the second phase of an ongoing research project by presenting a certificate validation and sharing framework that guarantees authenticity through leveraging the privacy and security features of a blockchain network. The framework also covers the architectural design of a blockchain-based certificating system to solve problems and offer solutions in the context of higher education. Two groups of participants are also included in an empirical study focusing on an evaluation of the proposed framework in relation to its ability to describe and explain blockchain adoption in higher education. The validity and reliability of the framework is tested using a sequential mixed methods design involving the collection of quantitative survey data.

These blocks are groups of transactions that make up a sequence where each block contains the cryptographic hash of its prior block. To maintain huge networks, data integrity, and consistency some blockchain deployments uses a distributed communication method known as gossip protocol. In gossip protocol, every node/system relays any recent data to all its neighbors in an atomic fashion where each neighbor imitates the process until the whole system is synchronized. The number of iterations required to synchronize N hosts is O (log N) despite the failing nodes and data losses in transmission. However, the protocol is not cost effective when it comes to number of state exchanges and the transmission delay due to the redundant state information exchanges. To make gossip protocol more efficient; first, we propose a fail-proof algorithm that can be used under zero node failure scenarios; secondly, an opportunistic algorithm giving a rational, stable, and predictable correction phase and lastly a checking algorithm that obtains an iterative correction until a convergence or a synchronization across all the nodes in the system are reached.

The crucial idea is to scan and record close contacts between users using mobile devices, in order to notify persons when their close contact(s) is diagnosed positive. Current contact tracing systems’ false-positive rate is too high to be practical as they do not filter Bluetooth scan results outside range of infection. Furthermore current systems neglect airborne transmission other than droplet transmission. Moreover, the ability granted to service providers of the contact tracing systems to access user data violates user privacy. Finally, attackers can modify, remove or fabricate contact records in their devices, which harms the integrity of the system. In this paper, we propose and develop a new contact tracing system which uses environmental factors to filter out results outside estimated effective transmission distance, and also take airborne transmission into consideration. In addition, we implement a rerandomizable signature scheme with blockchain bulletin board to provide confidentiality and integrity. We also evaluate the performance of our theory by implementing our algorithm on mobile devices. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Contact-tracing; Epidemiology; Fluid dynamics; Public key rerandomizable; TraceabilityFluid dynamics; Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; Airborne transmission; Block-chain; Contact tracing; Fluid-dynamics; Privacy preserving; Public key rerandomizable; Public keys; Scientific community; Traceability; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Though, farmers are not getting adequate profit due to the intermediaries and inefficient supply chain system. Farmers will begin producing more once they stand to benefit from higher farm produce rates, which is not the case at the moment. Technology innovation in the agricultural sector is essential for the development of efficient and productive food systems. In this paper, we propose a novel system for automating and controlling the supply chain process through blockchain and smart contracts, while maintaining total trust between the parties. In particular, we design smart contracts with two parameters, Minimum Purchase Rate (MPR) and Percentage Profit Share (PPS), to monitor the cost of product and to increase the farmer’s income. The payment history is recorded in a distributed ledger and can be used to trace back to the source of the products. Furthermore, the proposed framework is constructed and tested in an Ethereum blockchain network.

Rising incidents of data infringements and identity thefts in a centralized identity system are a growing concern. Blockchain-based identity solutions gained a competitive edge over the present centralized identity system due to the features of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Claims (VC).

Their openness mandates effective auditing mechanisms to assure users that their data remains intact. A blockchain is typically employed here as an unbiased public auditor. While the case for static data is relatively easy to handle, on-chain auditing of dynamic data with practical performance guarantees is still an open problem. Dynamic Proof-of-Storage (PoS) schemes developed for conventional cloud storage are not applicable to DS, since they require large storage proofs and/or large auditor states that are unmanageable by resource-constrained blockchains. To fill the gap, we propose a family of dynamic on-chain auditing protocols that can produce concretely small auditor states while retaining the compact proofs promised by static PoS schemes. Our design revolves around a set of succinct data structures and optimization techniques for index information management. With proper instantiation and realistic parameters, our protocols can achieve 0.25MB on-chain state and 1.2KB storage proof for the auditing of 1TB data, outperforming previous dynamic PoS schemes that are adaptable for DS by orders of magnitude. As another practical contribution, we introduce a data abstraction layer that allows one to deploy the auditing protocols on arbitrary storage systems hosting dynamic data.

To overcome security issues and eradicate third-party involvement, Blockchain technology is the modern-day solution in an IoT environment. In the context of a Secured IoT system, we proposed a novel chaotic encryption-based blockchain-IoT architecture to clinch the security and privacy of data.

We obtained an NPCR of 99.65%, a UACI of 34%, and an entropy value close to 8. These values incite that the novel chaotic encryption-based blockchain-IoT architecture will be safe from IoT attacks.

To comply with the criteria of the European Union&#x0027;s General Data Protection Regulation, it is important to ensure that personal data can be completely removed by their owners. To improve the privacy and security of the P2P file-sharing system, we propose a revocable and monitorable P2P file-sharing system over a consortium blockchain to achieve revocation of files in the decentralized environment. By using a trusted execution environment, such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), the proposed scheme can verify the integrity of the executables of the P2P file-sharing system and generate a file authentication code for each IPFS node to make sure that the system is synchronized correctly. This scheme elaborately integrates the autonomous smart contracts and Intel SGX hardware to obtain the monitorable merit.

In real intelligent manufacturing scenarios, heterogeneous multi-source fusion data are collected at the same time period. So they are consistent in time state. For the autonomous digital twin system, time states verification and integrity checking are basic security factors. Provable data possession technology can check the integrity of data onto virtual spaces. The blockchain can provide the synchronization interface to make distributed entities to obtain the trusted time state value. Considering the privacy, the blockchain can also provide anonymous services for entities. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based synchronized provable data possession scheme (named BSPDP) for digital twin. In our scheme, the selection of verifier is flexible. Since virtual spaces may be maliciously framed to pay compensation, we use tag verification to prevent honest virtual spaces from being framed. Under the assumption of RSA, the proposed BSPDP is provably secure. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that BSPDP is practical.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce a new encryption scheme called deniable matchmaking encryption (DME). This new encryption scheme provides deniability not only for the message, but also for the identities.

In addition, security and privacy issues should not be ignored. During MCS' execution, the participants' various information and truth value are usually exposed, and the computation related to data privacy cannot be verified.

This requires that no one&#x0027;s computational power exceeds 50% of the network power. However, recent attacks on blockchains have raised serious questions about their security and whether they can be trusted to be employed in critical infrastructure and Industry 4.0. In this paper, we introduce a new category of blockchain attacks which we call &#x0022;Misleading-Attacks&#x0027;&#x0027;. In this type of attack, a fraction of network power is mislead so that the attacker reaches her goal. The technique is most effective when miners are rational and algorithm-oriented, similar to machines/agents in future Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this technique has the potential to be used in inventing new attacks, or can be used in combination with other known attacks. We first analyze a case in which the attacker uses misleading techniques to prevent her newly mined block from becoming orphan.

Despite the exponential increases, the tools and technologies developed to manage these data volumes are not intended to meet security and data protection requirements. Additionally, most of the current big data security systems are offered by a centralized third party, which is vulnerable to many security threats. Blockchain technology plays a significant role by addressing modern technology concerns such as decentralization, non-tampering, trust, data ownership, and traceability, making it great potential to protect personal information. This research presents a new big data security solution empowered by blockchain technology and incorporates fragmentation, encryption, and access control techniques. Our proposed fragmentation algorithm takes into account the data owner's demand for encryption to be added to the fragmentation process. Furthermore, data fragments will be stored in the distributed manner offered by the big data environment, resulting in an additional layer of data protection. In order to achieve an optimal security solution, we aim to enhance big data security with acceptable overhead and avoid the encryption overhead for non-sensitive and low-sensitive data portions. We present the results of our implemented techniques to highlight that the overheads (in terms of computation time) introduced by our solution are negligible relative to its security and privacy gains. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Distributed control systems allow direct communication between the secondary controllers and controls the parameters efficiently. To secure each distributed control process and ensure a good quality of control results, a Proof-of-Authority private blockchain is applied in this study to defend the distributed control system against various types of cyber-attacks such as false data injection. A four-DG islanded microgrid is tested with the implementation of the blockchain. Smart contracts are created to calculate the control feedback and return the value to corresponding secondary controllers. All of the four nodes are initially assigned as the authority nodes to share the mining burden, but according to the Proof-of-Authority consensus protocol, the authority role could be excluded if the node behaves illegally and causes damage to the control system. In addition, different attacking scenarios are categorized and analyzed with their respective solutions. Finally, a case study is introduced to verify the corresponding solutions and proves that the proposed method is able to secure the distributed control system while ensuring the control quality.

To solve these issues, we are motivated to propose a mining framework of alleviating miner's computation-intensive mining burdens, as well as enabling mobile devices' participation.

The consensus protocol is a core component of a blockchain network through which all the blockchain peers achieve an agreement about the state of the distributed ledger. Therefore, its security, trustworthiness, and correctness have vital importance. This work proposes a Secure and Trustworthy Blockchain-based Crowdsourcing (STBC) consensus protocol to address these challenges.

In the upper layer, the microgrids trade energy with each other, and in the lower layer, users trade energy within the microgrid. Traditional management schemes based on the cooperation mode or island mode of the microgrids can no longer meet the needs of energy trading. In this paper, we propose an energy trading management solution for the bi-layer energy trading scenario. In order to maximize the bi-layer&#x2019;s (i.e., users&#x2019; and microgrid operators&#x2019; (MGOs)) utility functions under the condition of the local energy supply and demand, we propose a multi-objective optimization model. To solve the optimization model, we give a solution Energy Trading Management Algorithm (ETMA) based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA). Moreover, the proposed energy trading framework which is based on multi-blockchain ensures the security and privacy of energy trading, and a consensus mechanism named Delegated Proof of Reputation (DPoR) is proposed to urge users to complete the transaction according to their promised trading schemes. Experiments based on the real data of Guizhou are done to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization model. The results show that our proposed model can achieve better performance in terms of users&#x2019; and MGOs&#x2019; utility functions in the bi-layer energy trading scenario compared with the traditional models.

These benefits, however, are currently restricted to users in metropolitan cities. Expansion of these services to rural areas is hindered by the lack of economic incentives for providers, forcing remote populations to use legacy pre-5G technologies. The key features of 5G include small cells, low-cost radio access points, energy-efficient data centers, and low footprint dedicated networks. The impact of these features in an urban context has been widely discussed, but they also have immense potential to serve the unique and differentiated needs of rural communities, servicing quality-of-life improvements through precision agriculture, augmented reality telemedicine, and reliable disaster support. These critical services can be realized through dedicated spectrum allocation by regulating authorities, and the regionalization lowers costs, allowing for rapid deployment of 5G local networks. In this scenario, the interplay between local community networks and public mobile networks is of paramount importance. The roles of reference design, system architecture, and effective smart contracts in the creation of sustainable communication infrastructure have been outlined in this paper. Disaggregated radio access network (Open RAN) and blockchain have been integrated into the framework, allowing rapid, end-to-end secure data communication. The use of network slicing and effective co-operation between local community networks and mobile network operators, together with the elucidated framework, enable efficient, privacy-conscious networking which can be relied upon for the delivery of critical services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","5G; Blockchain; Data privacy; LCN; Network slicing; Open RAN; Smart contract; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals","非CCF推荐");

Specifically, the DBC is a private blockchain deployed on a cloud-fog communication network which is composed of an information blockchain (IBC) storing large amounts of IoT data in the cloud layer and a reputation blockchain (RBC) storing reputation data of the IoT devices in the near-terminal fog layer. The locations of the fog layer nodes are modeled according to a random Poisson point process (PPP) over a given two-dimensional area to approximate the stochastic property of real-world wireless node deployments. Furthermore, we assume that the number of IoT devices transmitting to the fog nodes also follow a random Poisson distribution. Based on these models, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the storage size, transmission latency, and tampering time of the IoT fog nodes in our DBC architecture. Numerical simulations highlight high storage scalability, low latency, and superior security of the DBC design, and provide insights into the performance gains for different fog node and IoT device densities.

According to the current voting system of India, every person casts a vote using an electronic voting machine, in a voting booth. Once the voting time has elapsed, the votes are counted. However, the transparency is not maintained. There is also a possibility of system rigging and delay in results. Blockchain being a distributed ledger and a transparent system is hence a better alternative to the current voting system. This ensures a secure, reliable and decentralized voting environment. E-voting system using blockchain works as a step towards creating a secure and transparent environment for elections where the users will be able to cast their votes only once and will be able to view the total votes cast in real time without having the permission to edit the same after elections get over. The working of blockchains will ensure the votes are maintained and the systems are not rigged by any third party. The secure electronic voting system uses blockchain which is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transaction ledger. The system will create permissioned blocks from the authorized nodes where the casted votes will be considered as individual transactions. These blocks are counted, and the results are then announced. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Admin; Authentication; Blockchain; Decentralized; E-voting; Electronic voting machine; Encryption; Hash; Secret key; Voter","非CCF推荐");

They form a large distributed network together, which can facilitate the integration of Distributed Energy Stations (DESs) and corresponding smart aggregators. Nevertheless, because of potential security and privacy protection arising from trustless energies trading, how to make such energies trading go smoothly is a tricky challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multiple energies trading (B-MET) system for secure and efficient energies trading by executing a smart contract we design. Because energies trading requires the blockchain in B-MET system to have high throughput and low latency, we design a new byzantine-based consensus mechanism (BCM) based on node&#x2019;s credit to improve efficiency for the consortium blockchain under the B-MET system. Then, we take combined heat and power (CHP) system as a typical example that provides distributed energies. We quantify their utilities and model the interactions between aggregators and DESs in a smart city by a novel multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. It is analyzed and solved by reaching Nash equilibrium between aggregators, which reflects the competition between aggregators to purchase energies from DESs. In the end, we conduct plenty of numerical simulations to evaluate and verify our proposed model and algorithms, which demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.

Then we design an adaptive data smoothing and compression mechanism (ADSC) to reduce IoE data size, analyze and store those data in the edge gateways with limited computation and storage capacity for correctly characterizing logistics operations and transactions. Moreover, to ensure the data integrity during last-mile delivery, the mobile edge gateway is adopted when the goods is temporarily off the communication range of the fixed edge gateway in the truck.

With allegations being raised on validity of the voting system and mass protests, e.g., in the USA as well as the allegations of some hired tech companies interfering in elections of different countries, it is indispensable to have a reliable voting system to know the opinion of the voters. As paper ballot has its own issues of processing, safety and ease of e-voting is the way forward. Blockchain-based e-voting system can fix the loopholes that lead to voting frauds by first providing a unique ID to the voter and the eligible voters can cast a ballot anonymously at his comfort using a PC or smartphone. Second, the BEV’s encrypted key and tamper-proof personal IDs can help to ensure the validity of the submitted vote, if any discrepancy happens it can be easily identified by the modified blockchain. The blockchain-enabled e-voting system relies on the encrypted data transfer and storage on distributed ledger that can be confirmed from any node of the blockchain. The voter ID cards are issued to the eligible voters, this ID card contains encrypted files that identify the owner and allows him/her to carry out a number of online transactions; say, for example, for a single time voting a single “coin” can be uploaded to the wallet of the user account that can be used to cast their vote only once. The voters are allowed to change their vote as many times they wish for a particular duration, say three days till the voting closes. Once the user confirms the vote by using the verification PIN or credentials, it is verified for authenticity. In the next stage, the identified authentic votes are transferred to the counting server and accounted for as advised by the voter. A non-blockchain e-voting system may leave many points where the frauds can happen for example under reporting of votes received, selecting a few responses that favor some candidate, corrupting the data, or erasing the data rendering the voting exercise invalid, etc. Blockchain proposes the possible solutions to each of these problems of the existing e-voting systems in practice. The BEV can provide the solution to the challenges any voting system in any level of organization may face, e.g., no coercion of the voters, anonymity of the voter, proof of a valid vote, correct counting and accounting of votes, avoiding single entity control on vote tallying and election result announcement, weeding out ineligible voters. All these issues will be discussed in detail in the chapter. This chapter often uses blockchain currency analogy to keep the reader interested and makes it easier for the reader who is not familiar with the blockchain technology or is familiar only with the bitcoins and focuses on major issues like voter access and voter fraud.

In VANETs, secure communication must be ensured, as otherwise it can lead to traffic accidents and human injuries. Recently, many studies on V2I authentication have been conducted to guarantee the security of V2I communications. However, recent V2I authentication protocols do not consider the handover situation, and it causes unnecessary computations. As vehicles have limited computing resources, unnecessary computation can lead to overload to the vehicles. In recent years, blockchain-based VANET is an active field of research because it can provide decentralization, data integrity and transparency. Using the strength of the blockchain technology, we design a blockchain-based handover authentication protocol for VANETs.

By allowing Turing-complete programming languages to implement smart contracts, recent blockchains such as Ethereum can reduce needs in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs. However, subtle errors in smart contracts have induced an enormous financial loss-for examples, the DAO attack, Parity multisignature wallet attacks, and integer underflow/overflow attacks. To identify such errors in smart contracts, various researches are performed, which are based on static analysis and theorem proving. However, they only support inspection for pre-defined error patterns, or they cannot explore the whole searching space exhaustively or be fully automatic. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel formal verification technique to analyze blockchain smart contracts by using ATL model checking. In our methodology, we represent the interaction between users and smart contracts into a two-player game and verify properties we want to check using MCMAS that is an efficient ATL model checker for multi-agent systems. Moreover, we present three case studies to show that our proposal can successfully identify subtle flaws in real world smart contracts.

However, energy transaction, network interconnection, the intermittent nature of renewable sources, and other problems lead to challenges in the practical implementation of networked microgrids. Despite its favorable use of space, a floating PV system presents challenges that differ from those associated with its land-based counterparts because it is prone to the motion of the surface of the water, resulting in an unpredictable power output. This work presents a hierarchical energy management system (EMS) to address these issues. In level 1 of the EMS, which is for the overall management thereof, a blockchain model is used to manage transactions among microgrids. A grid synchronization algorithm is implemented in level 2 of the EMS, which manages the interconnection of microgrids. Level 2 is activated when an energy transaction between microgrids is needed. An on-line recurrent neural network (RNN)-based controller for an energy storage system (ESS), which is designed specifically to mitigate the problem caused by a floating PV platform, is deployed in level 3 as a local controller. The results of a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation demonstrate that the EMS can properly coordinate the levels in the hierarchical scheme to interconnect and provide power support between the microgrids. Real-time simulation results show that the ESS controller responds well, proving the viability of the hardware controller. According to these findings, the hierarchical EMS that is proposed in this work can solve the considered problems. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

To make fast integration of this technology in various domains some prominent issues like scalability, high throughput, processing delay need to be resolved. Blockchain architecture is decentralized with distributed system approach, where maintaining the privacy of every block comes at the cost of scalability of the network. Scalability is the problem associated with transaction rate (throughput) of the system. Therefore to make a blockchain technology embedded within the mainstream it is necessary for it to be secure and scalable at the same time. To deal with the issue of scalability proposed framework attempts to localize the privacy requirement on a block level along with a simple but efficient consensus algorithm.

Medical data hacking is a trending business followed by many hackers in the black market. To deal with such issues, cloud-based security solutions are being developed day by day. Design complexity is a big issue in all conventional methods, even in various technological facilities for security-related issues in the medical field. This paper combines elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and blockchain encryption to develop an efficient steganography technique for data hiding in the multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) channel. This hybrid encryption method is named reconfigurable area-power efficient steganography (RAPS) for MIMO-OFDM channel coding. Generally, the performance of ECC encryption is affected by the design complexity due to the use of several units. Mainly, the use of complex multiplier units creates a major problem in ECC design. Therefore, the Montgomery multiplier is used in the proposed work for ECC design because it provides faster multiplication with simpler operations. Also, the combination of blockchain technology with ECC provides additional security features like immutability, decentralization and elimination of third-party. This hybrid encryption technique uses Low-Density Parity Check for efficient data transmission between sender-receiver. The proposed RAPS technique with MIMO-OFDM design is implemented using MATLAB and Xilinx platform.

The supply chain governance of agricultural products is taken as the research object. Initially, the stabilities of two supply chain organization modes, "company and farmer"and "company, intermediary organization and farmer,"are analyzed by static game analysis. Then, based on the above analysis and the characteristics of blockchain institutional technology, a detailed analyzation is made on the mechanism of supply chain of agricultural products governance based on blockchain technology. Finally, the functional framework of agricultural supply chain governance is designed based on the basic framework of blockchain technology, and analyzation is made on the trust mechanism and contract mechanism of agricultural supply chain governance based on blockchain technology. The research results show that problems such as information and cognitive constraints in agricultural supply chain governance cannot be completely solved only through the evolution of blockchain organizational structure and the supply of governance mechanism, and speculative behavior will still appear. Optimizing the governance of supply chain of agricultural products based on blockchain technology can realize the transformation of its governance scenario. Meanwhile, the blockchain technologies such as deintermediation, demistrust, and intelligent contract play an important role in the process of agricultural supply chain governance, which can make it change in many aspects such as organization mode, application operation, and governance mechanism.

To maintain blockchain and save operation cost, IoT nodes may play roles of miners (who generate or mine blocks), by renting mining rigs from edge computing service providers. During the mining process, miners will receive rewards, while these rewards incentivize miners to keep mining in turn. However, if the rewards are insufficient, there might be a gap time where no miners participate in mining. We call a blockchain without a gap time a normal chain and a gap chain otherwise. This paper is the first to investigate the allocation of edge computing resources when normal and gap chains coexist. In this paper, we propose a normal gap game to model the allocation over the two types of blockchains which was never proposed before. In our game, miners compete with each other to maximize their respective utilities, by determining the per chain shares and the starting time of their mining rigs. We then develop a calculation framework, which factors in various system parameters to quantify the investment and allocation of mining rigs. We finally evaluate the miners’ utilities under different scenarios.

Given this problem, many scaling schemes have been put forward. A layer 2 network is a technology that solves the performance problem of blockchain. Connected parties in this network can set up channels to send digital currency to each other. Since the interaction with the blockchain is only required when the channel is established and closed, a large number of transactions do not need to be recorded on the blockchain, thus reducing the blockchain capacity. Due to the special structure of the payment channel, the distribution of funds in the channel is often unbalanced, which limits the route payment to a certain extent. This paper improves the original payment method in the second layer network by introducing new scripts. The new payment scheme supports proof of payment which is integral to the nature of the lightning network and divides the payment into several subpayments, so the large payment can be divided into relatively small payments. Due to the capacity limitation of the payment channel, theoretically, the success rate of the micropayment route is higher.

Herein, a framework of blockchain-enabled ATCS (BATCS) is provided as a blockchain-based I-TMS application to collect TAs without stopping vehicles while they pass the toll plaza. Smart contracts are used to authenticate vehicles’ data and to collect TAs automatically. An efficient algorithm is presented for data verification and TA collection in this paper. This research work provides a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving framework in the field of the ETC system. The significant contributions of the BATCS compared with the RFID-based system are less fuel consumption and time-saving for a vehicle. The proposed framework can enhance data security and user privacy in the intelligent decentralized ETC system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Blockchain-enabled ETC system; Decentralized electronic toll collection; Intelligent transportation management system; Smart contractData privacy; Information management; Taxation; Toll highways; Vehicles; Block-chain; Blockchain-enabled electronic toll collection system; Decentralised; Decentralized electronic toll collection; Electronic toll collection; Electronic toll collection systems; Intelligent transportation; Intelligent transportation management system; Transportation management systems; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

Thus, in this paper, we provide a novel idea to construct the integrity verification scheme via blockchain. The construction of the proposed scheme is based on identity-based encryption (IBE) which avoids the complex certificate management caused by the public key infrastructure (PKI). Our scheme decides to upload tags set to the blockchain to achieve the separate storage of the tags set and files. The characteristics of the blockchain determine that the tags set will not be forged. But separate storage may cause the information returned by the three parties participating in the public auditing to be out of sync; thus, a small data structure—audit log is introduced to solve this problem. The advantages of audit log can not only guarantee the correct and smooth implementation of the proposed scheme, but also prove the TPA’s innocence when necessary. Moreover, the security of our scheme is strictly proved. Finally, a series of performance evaluations demonstrate that our scheme is efficient and feasible. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Cloud security storage; Identity-based encryption; Integrity verification; Public auditingCloud data security; Digital storage; Public key cryptography; Audit logs; Block-chain; Cloud securities; Cloud security storage; Data integrity; Identity Based Encryption; Identity-based; Integrity verifications; Public auditing; Security storages; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

With the recent rise of smart systems (e.g. Internet of things) and digital platforms (e.g. blockchain), smart contracts are gaining high interest in both business and academia. In this work, a framework for smart contracts was proposed with using reputation as the system currency, and conducts currency mining through fulfilling the physical commitments that are agreed upon. Design/methodology/approach: A game theory model is developed to represent the proposed system, and then a system dynamics simulator is used to check the response of the blockchain with different sizes. Findings: The numerical results showed that the proposed system could identify the takeover attacks and protect the blockchain from being controlled by an outsider. Another important finding is that careful setting of the maximum currency amount can improve the scalability of the blockchain and prevent the currency inflation. Research limitations/implications: This work is proposed as a conceptual framework for supply chain 4.0. Future work will be dedicated to implement and experiment the proposed framework for other characteristics that may be encountered in the context of supply chain 4.0, such as different suppliers' tiers, different customer typologies and smart logistics applications, which may reveal other challenges and provide additional interesting insights. Practical implications: By using the proposed framework, smart contracts and blockchains can be implemented to handle many issues in the context of operations and supply chain 4.0, especially in times of turbulence such as the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis. Originality/value: This work emphasizes that smart contracts are not too smart to be applied in the context of supply chain 4.0. The proposed framework of smart contracts is expected to serve supply chain 4.0 by automating the knowledge work and enabling scenario planning through the game theory model. It will also improve online transparency and order processing in real-time through secured multitier connectivity.

Steemit is recognized as one of the earliest blockchain-based online communities, and a typical example of DAO. By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals.

As the available space inside a block is limited, users must compete against each other by submitting higher fees to obtain this limited resource. In this paper, we model blockchain transaction inclusion as a time-sensitive dynamic game, where users base their fees depending on both what their competitors in the network are offering, and by their own urgency of having their transactions approved. We then investigate the effect that mempool congestion (the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed) and different block sizes have on the fees users would be willing to pay. Our analysis concludes that miners have no rational reason to artificially limit the block size, which is in direct contrast with previous research findings. Instead, we find that increasing the block size in relation to a growing mempool both lowers the individual fees that users have to pay, and increases the total in fees collected, which raises not only the utility of the miners, but also of the regular users of the blockchain system. © 2021 IEEE.","bitcoin; block size; Blockchain; game theory; transaction feesBitcoin; Blockchain; Miners; Block sizes; Block-chain; Game; Game theoretic analysis; License; Security; Solid modelling; Transaction fee; Two ways; Game theory","非CCF推荐");

Prior works have explored automated exploit generation for vulnerable Ethereum contracts. However, the scopes of prior works are limited in both vulnerability types and contract platforms. In this paper, we propose a cross-platform framework, called EXGEN, to generate multiple transactions as exploits to given vulnerable smart contracts. EXGEN first translates either Ethereum or EOS contracts to an intermediate representation (IR). Then, EXGEN generates symbolic attack contracts with transactions in a partial order and then symbolically executes the attack contracts together with the target to find and solve all the constraints. Lastly, EXGEN concretizes all the symbols, generates attack contracts with multiple transactions, and verifies the generated contracts' exploitability on a private chain with values crawled from the public chain. We implemented a prototype of EXGEN and evaluated it on Ethereum and EOS benchmarks. EXGEN successfully exploits 1,258/1,399 (89.9%) Ethereum and 126/130 (96.9%) EOS vulnerabilities. EXGEN is also able to find zero-day vulnerabilities on EOS.

Due to this special property, the range proof protocols have been widely applied in various scenarios especially those requiring security requirements of identity or data privacy protection (e.g. blockchain, anonymous certificates, electronic cash, group or ring signatures). Correspondingly, there are also many design methods of range proof protocols have been proposed recently, such as square decomposition method, signature-based method, inner-product argument method, and so forth, among which the signature-based method (proposed by Camenisch et al. in the conference of ASIACRYPT 2008) is one of the most widely used methods at present. However, the range proof protocols proposed by Camenisch et al. not only require a high time-consuming and costly bilinear pairing computation, but also involve a cumbersome certificate management overhead. This means that the utility of their proposed protocols still needs to be further improved. He et al. used the Chinese cryptographic SM9 digital signature algorithm to design two novel range proof protocols without the need of certificate managements, which have been applied for a patent in China (where the patent application publication number is No. CN110311776A). Nevertheless, their proposed protocols are still involved with the bilinear pairing operation, resulting in that their proposals also require a high computational cost. To further reduce the computational cost of existing range proof protocols and also enrich the applications of Chinese cryptographic algorithms, this paper also adopts the signature-based method, but uses an identity-based digital signature algorithm (constructed from the Chinese cryptographic SM2 algorithm) instead to propose a novel set membership protocol. This design can efficiently solve the issues of certificate management and bilinear pairing overhead at the same time. Moreover, we extend our designed set membership protocol to construct a novel numerical range proof protocol, so as to support a wider numerical range of zero-knowledge proofs. Also, in order to prove the security of our proposed two protocols, we first prove the security of the adopted identity-based digital signature algorithm, that is, this signature scheme is proven owning existential unforgery against adaptively chosen message and ID attacks (abbreviated as EUF-CM-ID-A). On basic of this security proof, we then demonstrate that our proposals own the security properties of completeness, special soundness and honest-verifier zero-knowledge. In comparison with Camenisch et al.'s and He et al.'s proposed protocols and using the same optimized parameters, the main communication overhead in our protocols is only about 1568 bytes which has reduced about 41.66% and 78.12% respectively, and the main computation cost in our protocols is only about 491.5075 milliseconds, which has saved about 85.93% and 85.85% respectively. This indeed demonstrates that our proposed protocols have the stronger utility comparing to the existing signature-based range proof protocols, and hence they are more suitable for satisfying requirements of identity or data privacy protection and validity verification in the aforementioned scenarios. © 2022, Science Press.

Therefore, a novel mode-based hash chain for secure mutual authentication is necessary to address the Internet of Things (IoT) devices’ vulnerability, as there have been several years of growing concerns regarding their security. Therefore, a novel model is designed that is stronger and effective against any kind of unauthorized attack, as IoT devices’ vulnerability is on the rise due to the mass production of IoT devices (embedded processors, camera, sensors, etc.), which ignore the basic security requirements (passwords, secure communication), making them vulnerable and easily accessible. Furthermore, crackable passwords indicate that the security measures taken are insufficient. As per the recent studies, several applications regarding its requirements are the IoT distributed denial of service attack (IDDOS), micro-cloud, secure university, Secure Industry 4.0, secure government, secure country, etc. The problem statement is formulated as the “design and implementation of dynamically interconnecting fog servers and edge devices using the mode-based hash chain for secure mutual authentication protocol”, which is stated to be an NP-complete problem. The hash-chain fog/edge implementation using timestamps, mode-based hash chaining, the zero-knowledge proof property, a distributed database/blockchain, and cryptography techniques can be utilized to establish the connection of smart devices in large numbers securely. The hash-chain fog/edge uses blockchain for identity management only, which is used to store the public keys in distributed ledger form, and all these keys are immutable. In addition, it has no overhead and is highly secure as it performs fewer calculations and requires minimum infrastructure. Therefore, we designed the hash-chain fog/edge (HCFE) protocol, which provides a novel mutual authentication scheme for effective session key agreement (using ZKP properties) with secure protocol communications. The experiment outcomes proved that the hash-chain fog/edge is more efficient at interconnecting various devices and competed favorably in the benchmark comparison. © 2022 by the authors.

However, in the existing schemes, the devices need to store complete block data and traverse a large number of blocks to find the corresponding data when retrieving or verifying specific data on the chain, which reduces the response speed of the user side in the edge computing scene. In addition, traditional consensus algorithms are not suitable for terminal devices with limited resources. To address the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a multi-layer blockchain network model for edge computing. Specifically, the model is divided into three layers: terminal layer, edge layer, and core layer. The terminal layer is divided into multiple local networks, each of which contains a terminal side blockchain storing the data generated by the terminal node in the local network. Blockchain data between different local networks are isolated from each other, which improves the security and privacy of data in local networks. The edge side blockchain located in the edge layer regularly backs up the terminal side blockchain in each local network of the terminal layer. Many edge nodes are deployed in the edge layer, which periodically repackage the block data on the terminal side blockchain and publish it on the edge blockchain. Some core devices are deployed in the core layer, which are responsible for the audit, registration and other work of the nodes in the edge layer. We conduct experiments on simulated data, and the results show that the speed of finding a specific data hash in the model is 4-7 times faster than the traditional directed acyclic graph blockchain model. We also propose an adaptive workload proof algorithm of which the execution difficulty can be dynamically adjusted according to the behaviors of the terminal node. The algorithm is improved based on the traditional proof-of-work algorithm, which introduces the concept of node contribution value in the multi-layer blockchain network model. The node contribution value is used to quantitatively analyze the historical behavior attributes of terminal nodes. The edge node will periodically check the block content published on the terminal side blockchain, and calculate the contribution value of the terminal node in the local network according to the predefined computational formula. Then the terminal node sets the difficulty of the workload proof algorithm it executes according to the contribution value. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional proof-of-work algorithm, the transaction efficiency of normal nodes that execute the adaptive algorithm is improved by 4-5 times. © 2022, Science Press.

The unification of edge computing and Blockchain within one solution jar provides a vast scale of storage systems, database servers, and authenticity computation towards the end in a safe fashion. Despite the potential of interconnected edge computing and Blockchain environments, difficulties such as scalability, resource management, function integration, self-organization, and new security concerns must be addressed before broad adoption. This article provides an overview of the secure IoT framework, paradigms, enablers, and security problems of combining Blockchain and intelligent edge computing. Finally, broader viewpoints for future research directions are investigated.

In concept, blockchain has a linear structure that grows with the number of transactions entered. This growth in size is the main obstacle to the blockchain, which makes it unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. Moreover, conventional consensus algorithms such as PoW, PoS are very computationally heavy. This paper solves these problems by introducing a new lightweight blockchain structure and lightweight consensus algorithm. The Multi-Zone Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) Blockchain (Multizone-DAG-Blockchain) framework is proposed for the fog-based IoT environment. In this context, fog computing technology is integrated with the IoT to offload IoT tasks to the fog nodes, thus preserving the energy consumption of the IoT devices. Both IoT and fog nodes are initially authenticated using a non-cloneable physical function- based validation mechanism (DPUF-VM) in which multiple authentication certificates are verified in the blockchain. Each transaction is stored in a hash function in the blockchain using the lightweight CubeHash algorithm and signed by the Four-Q- Curve algorithm. In the cloud, sensitive data is stored as ciphertext. Fog nodes provide data security to avoid the energy consumption and complexity of IoT nodes. The fog node first performs a redundancy analysis using the Jaccard Similarity (JS) measure and sensitivity analysis using the Neutrosophic Neural Intelligent Network (N2IN) algorithm. A lightweight proof-of-authentication (PoAh) algorithm is presented and executed by the optimal consensus node selected by the bi- objective spiral optimization (BoSo) algorithm for transaction validation. The proposed work is modeled in Network Simulator 3.26 (ns-3.26), and the performance is evaluated in terms of energy consumption, storage cost, response time, and throughput. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Subsequently, we extend it to an n-party key agreement to propose a Blockchain-based Dynamic Authenticated Contributory Group Key Agreement (BDACGKA). In this technique, the privacy-preserving smart contract (PPSC) acts as a Group Controller in the first round and generates two-party shared keys with each group member. The PPSC computes partial group keys in the second round and sends them to the respective group members. After receiving the partial group keys sent by the PPSC, each group member generates the group key by multiplying the received product with its shared key.

However, traditional crowd sensing system relies on a centralized architecture, which not only face severe security and privacy issues, but also may not be able to attract enough users to participate in the sensing tasks due to the lack of effective incentive mechanisms and guaranteed rewards. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based crowd spectrum sensing framework to achieve secure and privacy-preserving spectrum sensing with guaranteed rewards for participating users. Considering the constraint of the sensing task and the workload of users, the optimal pricing and sensing task allocation scheme under the minimum sensing task constraint is investigated by leveraging Stackelberg game model. We analyze the Nash equilibrium of the sub-games and derive the optimal pricing and sensing task allocation strategy, for both uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing schemes.

The transmission of data (to and fro) related to these applications occur between the drones and the other infrastructure over wireless channels that must abide to the stringent latency restrictions. However, relaying this data to the core cloud infrastructure may lead to a higher round trip delay. Thus, we utilize the cloud close to the ground, i.e., edge computing to realize an edge-envisioned IoD ecosystem. However, as this data is relayed over an open communication channel, it is often prone to different types of attacks due to it wider attack surface. Thus, we need to find a robust solution that can maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data while providing desired services. Blockchain technology is capable to handle these challenges owing to the distributed ledger that store the data immutably. However, the conventional block architecture pose several challenges because of limited computational capabilities of drones. As the size of blockchain increases, the data flow also increases and so does the associated challenges. Hence, to overcome these challenges, in this work, we have proposed a derived blockchain architecture that decouples the data part (or block ledger) from the block header and shifts it to off-chain storage. In our approach, the registration of a new drone is performed to enable legitimate access control thus ensuring identity management and traceability. Further, the interactions happen in the form of transactions of the blockchain. We propose a lightweight consensus mechanism based on the stochastic selection followed by a transaction signing process to ensure that each drone is in control of its block. The proposed scheme also handles the expanding storage requirements with the help of data compression using a shrinking block mechanism. Lastly, the problem of additional delay anticipated due to drone mobility is handled using a multi-level caching mechanism. The proposed work has been validated in a simulated Gazebo environment and the results are promising in terms of different metrics. We have also provided numerical validations in context of complexity, communication overheads and computation costs. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Derived architecture; Edge computing; Internet of Drones; Security","非CCF推荐");

This article presents a combined MCGDM technique uniting the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and TODIM, a Portuguese acronym for interactive multi-criteria decision making, for selecting an appropriate blockchain technology provider with Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) information.

The signature generation time is 10ms, and the verification time required for access control is also less than 100 ms, which is the same even if the number of nodes increases, so scalability is not affected.

Recent advances in networking and distributed ledger technologies have enabled secure, improved information communication and broader connectivity. However, due to system interoperability, information quality, confidentiality, and trust, information cannot be exchanged seamlessly, resulting in the inefficiency of managing supply chain operations. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based inventory sharing approach based on smart contracts using a private Ethereum network to link suppliers and retailers. Our approach combines blockchain technology with decentralized storage to increase transparency, trust, and security of supply chain transactions. We present a generalized mechanism for secure information sharing that includes comprehensive algorithms to capture supply chain stakeholder interactions that enhance trust among participating entities. The smart contract was developed and validated using the Remix IDE, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We analyze the solution for various security vulnerabilities and provide a detailed cost analysis for various stakeholder transactions in the supply chain. Our solution demonstrates that a blockchain-based approach reduces inefficiencies, is economical, commercially viable, and provides improved information connectivity among supply chain stakeholders in a trusted and secure way. © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; Ethereum; Inventory sharing; supply chain disruption; transparencyCost benefit analysis; Distributed ledger; Ethereum; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Interoperability; Supply chains; Transparency; Block-chain; Information sharing; Inventory sharing; Security; Stakeholder; Supply chain inventories; Supply chain operation; Supply-chain disruptions; Sustainable supply chains; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

Blockchain technology mitigates the centralization problem by creating a decentralized, immutable and transparent control environment for automatic monitoring and control of industrial operations. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based IoT framework for real-time monitoring and control to increase oil field operation and asset efficiency and safety. We present the key components of the framework, including the system architecture, operation flows, algorithms, and smart contracts.

Moreover, the node's rapid energy dissipation due to the void holes and imbalanced network deployment has a bad impact on the network performance. To overcome the aforementioned issues, a blockchain based trust model for WSIoTs is proposed in this paper. Moreover, the Dijkstra algorithm is used to propose a routing protocol for performing efficient communication between network nodes while simultaneously avoiding void holes between ordinary sensor nodes and a sink node. Furthermore, to provide transparency in the network, all the transactions performed by the nodes are recorded in the blockchain in an immutable manner. Moreover, the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm is used to validate and add the transactions in the blocks. Besides, a distributed platform, known as interplanetary file system, is used in WSIoTs for reliable and cost-effective storage. The simulation results show that PoA performs 13% better than proof of work consensus algorithm.

However, this makes the privacy of blockchain users be an urgent problem. In order to solve the problem of transaction amount and identity exposure of both parties in alliance chain transaction, a privacy protection method of alliance chain based on group signature and homomorphic encryption is proposed. This method can protect the identity of the payee and the privacy of the transaction amount on the premise of meeting the traceability and verifiability of the transaction. In this scheme, the concept of group in group signature is combined with the alliance chain properly and we propose the concept of partial identity anonymity to make the user identity anonymous to other secondary nodes but verifiable to the primary nodes. Then the additive homomorphism property of Paillier homomorphism encryption is used to verify the legitimacy of the transaction and protect the privacy of the transaction amount. A four-step verification method for the main nodes is proposed, and through verifying the group signature, account ownership and the validity of the transaction amount, it realizes the supervision of the main nodes on the legality of the transaction.

A central administration of these systems manages the entire voting process and has partial or total control over the database and the system itself. This creates some problems, accidental or intentional, such as possible manipulation of the database and double voting. Many of these problems have been solved thanks to permissionless blockchain technologies in new voting systems; however, the classic consensus method of such blockchains requires specific computing power during each voting operation. This has a significant impact on power consumption, compromises the efficiency and increases the system latency. However, using a permissioned blockchain improves efficiency and reduces system energy consumption, mainly due to the elimination of the typical consensus protocols used by public blockchains. The use of smart contracts provides a secure mechanism to guarantee the accuracy of the voting result and make the counting procedure public and protected against fraudulent actions, and contributes to preserving the anonymity of the votes. Its adoption in electronic voting systems can help mitigate part of these problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a system that ensures high reliability by applying enterprise blockchain technology to electronic voting, securing the secret ballot. In addition, a flexible network configuration is presented, discussing how the solution addresses some of the security and reliability issues commonly faced by electronic voting system solutions. © 2022 by the authors.

However, due to the cost of communication and storage infrastructures, traditional online file management services, e.g., Google Drive and OneDrive, usually provide limited storage space and relatively low download speed for free users. To achieve better performance, ordinary users have to purchase their expensive services. Moreover, these file management systems are based on centralized architecture and bear the privacy leakage risk, because users' personal files are stored and controlled by their servers. To address the above problems, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) file management system based on IPFS and Hyperledger Fabric, named as FileWallet, which can serve as a personal wallet for individual users or organizations to store and share their files in a secure manner. In FileWallet, the users form a P2P network and a Fabric network, where P2P network builds the connections and distributed storage network and the Fabric network sustains consistent blockchain ledgers to record file operation related transactions. In our FileWallet, the storage and communication costs are mitigated in the decentralized design, and the file owner can fully control the access permission of the file to preserve the file privacy.

With the acceptance of IoT as a major part of the technology of Industry 4.0, the notion of leveraging the Internet in industries to enable automation and reconfigure existing industrial processes has greatly evolved. By introducing smart technology and intelligent processes, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is committed to bringing high operational efficiency, enhanced productivity, and effective management to industrial assets. Despite this, the reliance of IIoT on central architecture presents numerous challenges, including the security and maintenance of smart devices, privacy issues owing to third-party participation, and massive computations conducted by a central entity, all of which prevent its widespread adoption in businesses. Emerging blockchain technologies have the potential to transform IIoT platforms and applications. A distributed and decentralized approach followed by blockchain might offer interesting solutions to the challenges raised by IIoT. Furthermore, 5G networks are expected to deliver excellent solutions to meet the demands of decentralized systems, with a focus on application-specific vulnerabilities. Blockchain and IIoT, enabled by 5G, is a viable option to fully explore the potential of contemporary industry. In this context, this article analyzes and examines recent achievements to highlight the major obstacles in blockchain-IIoT convergence and presents a framework for potential solutions.

Due to the different coverage of the power Internet of Things, this paper proposes a node model based on the node network theory of blockchain technology. This model divides network nodes into data consumer nodes, data storage nodes, routing node, and coordination nodes according to business requirements. Through the cooperation of the four types of nodes, data sharing between multiple power Internet of Things can be realized efficiently. To solve the problem of low security in data sharing, this paper constructs a data transmission contribution analysis model of network nodes and a data access authorization model. The data transmission contribution degree model can fairly evaluate the behavior of network nodes based on the contribution degree, so as to quickly find malicious nodes. The data access authorization model calculates the entropy weight of each Internet of Things according to the trust level, thereby calculating the credibility of data sharing. To solve the problem of low transmission reliability of network nodes, a set of alternative links is constructed for data sharing routes. With load balancing as the goal, a relative cost value evaluation model is constructed for each route. The shortest route with the best relative cost value is regarded as the optimal data sharing route. In the simulation experiment, the related mechanisms are first improved based on the mechanism of this paper, which verifies that the mechanism of this paper improves the utilization and reliability of network resources in terms of data sharing routing. Secondly, it is verified that the mechanism of this paper improves the success rate and availability rate of network resources in terms of data security sharing. © 2021 IEEE.","data sharing; network model; Power Internet of Things; sharing mechanismBlockchain; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Information management; Network security; Reliability analysis; Routing algorithms; Virtual reality; Block-chain; Collaborative Work; Data Sharing; Data-communication; Network models; Power; Power internet of thing; Security; Sharing mechanism; Sharing network; Internet of things","非CCF推荐");

Bünz et al. recently presented a novel polynomial commitment scheme with no trusted setup in Eurocrypt’20. To provide a transparent setup, their scheme is built over an ideal class group of imaginary quadratic fields (or briefly, class group). However, cryptographic assumptions on a class group are relatively new and have, thus far, not been well-analyzed. In this paper, we study an approach to transpose Bünz et al.’s techniques in the discrete log setting because the discrete log setting brings a significant improvement in efficiency and security compared to class groups.

Such serial execution is unable to exploit modern multi-core resources efficiently, hence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance latency. The objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput by introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis over the transaction dependencies. We propose the DiPETrans framework for distributed execution of transactions in a block. Here, peers in the blockchain network form a community of trusted nodes to execute the transactions and find the PoW in-parallel, using a leader–follower approach. During mining, the leader statically analyzes the transactions, creates different groups (shards) of independent transactions, and distributes them to followers to execute concurrently. After execution, the community's compute power is utilized to solve the PoW concurrently. When a block is successfully created, the leader broadcasts the proposed block to other peers in the network for validation. On receiving a block, the validators re-execute the block transactions and accept the block if they reach the same state as shared by the miner. Validation can also be done in parallel, following the same leader–follower approach as mining. We report experiments using over 5 million real transactions from the Ethereum blockchain and execute them using our DiPETrans framework to empirically validate the benefits of our techniques over a traditional sequential execution. We achieve a maximum speedup of 2.2 (Formula presented.) and 2.0 (Formula presented.) and an average speedup of 1.6 (Formula presented.) and 1.5 (Formula presented.) for the miner and the validator, respectively, with 100–500 transactions per block when using 6 machines in the community.

Our research focuses on data and event models and secure upgradeable smart contract platforms for machine servitization. Our research indicates that with the proposed approaches, we can efficiently separate on-and off-chain data and assure scalability of the DApp without compro-mising the trust. We demonstrate that the secure upgradeable smart contract platform, which was adapted for machine servitization, supports the business workflow and, at the same time, assures common identification and authorization of all the participants in the system, including people, de-vices, and legal entities. We present a hybrid decentralized application (DApp) for the servitization of 3D printing. The solution can be used for or easily adapted to other manufacturing domains. It comprises a modular, upgradeable smart contract platform and off-chain machine, customer and web management, and monitoring interfaces. We pay special attention to the data and event models during the design, which are fundamental for the hybrid data storage and DApp architecture and the responsiveness of off-chain interfaces.

A widely adopted hash-based construction achieves an optimal gap in computational complexity between provers and verifiers.

The scammer attempts to create a striking headline that attracts the majority of users and attaches a link. The user follows the link and can be redirected to a fraudulent resource where the user easily loses personal data. To solve this problem, a Blockchain-enabled deep recurrent neural network (BDRNN) is proposed to detect the nature safe and malicious clickbait from the contents. The proposed BDRNN consists of three phases: analysis of clickbait and source rating, clickbait search process and multi-layered clickbait detection. The analysis of clickbait and source rating phase helps to analyze different sources to detect the clickbait and also rating the content-sources. To achieve the clickbait analysis and source rating, the detection of blocklisted/allowlisted source and source rating check algorithms are introduced. The clickbait search process is accomplished by incorporating the binary search features for a faster and more efficient search process for malicious content-detection. The multi-layered clickbait detection is main phase of the proposed BDRNN that consists of three models: content-to-vector model (layer-1), deep neural network model(layer-2), and Blockchain-enabled malicious content detection model (layer-3). These models collectively detect the malicious and safe clickbait from the contents. The extensive experiments are conducted to determine the effectiveness of the proposed BDRNN model and compared with the existing state-of-the-art neural network models designed for clickbait detection, and the result demonstrates that the proposed BDRNN model outperforms the counterparts from the, accuracy, link detection, memory usage, analogous perspectives, and attacker's successful content capturing rate. © 2013 IEEE.","Clickbait; Fraudulent Resources; Scam; SecurityBlockchain; Computer crime; Deep neural networks; Network layers; Social networking (online); Block-chain; Browser; Clickbait; Convolutional neural network; Fraudulend resource; Phishing; Recurrent neural network model; Scam; Security; Social networking (online); Recurrent neural networks","非CCF推荐");

This evolving technology is not limited to the financial organization but extended to various industry such as supply chain management, healthcare, insurance services, government, etc. The beauty of blockchain technology is that there is no single authority to control and verify the transactions, multiple participants spread over the network to contribute. To validate the transaction in a distributed environment, participants need to come into agreement that is called consensus. Through consensus mechanism a trust will be created in the distributed environment with immutability feature of blockchain technology. With the help of consensus algorithm, the transaction is validated and finally added to the blockchain. In this paper, we have presented the comprehensive investigation on existing consensus algorithm with different perception on various parameters. It is found the current consensus techniques used in different platform has some flaws and some advantages. This paper identified the key features and provided depth understanding of conceptual aspect with different views in terms of transaction, performance, architecture, type, etc. There is a need of efficient technique with better performance and less requirement of resources.

In a blockchain ecosystem, multiple parties across the network have to establish trust in an untrusted environment to ensure seamless nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation is a crucial factor for secure information auditing in the blockchain. To achieve this, we require an optimal digital signature. In this work, we design a digital signature to address the nonrepudiation challenge in blockchain ecosystems. Our approach developed in the current work completed signing and verification tasks with 10% and 13% shorter processing times, respectively than the conventional digital signature scheme. The adoption of the high-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) in a blockchain ecosystem can yield a 10% improvement in the transaction flow, a 10% improvement in block validation and a 40% decrease in storage costs relative to the same system implemented without HECAS.

In scholarship, the proposed solution for the consensus protocol is usually inspired by the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) based on voting rather than the proof-of-work (PoW). The advantage of PoW with respect to BFT is that it allows the final user to evaluate the cost required to change a confirmed transaction without the need to trust the consortium of miners. In this paper, we analyse the problems that arise from the application of PoW in permissioned blockchains. In standard PoW, it may be easy for colluded miners to temporarily reach 50% of the total hash power (HP). Moreover, since mining rewards are not usually expected in permissioned contexts, the problem of balancing the computational efforts among the miners becomes crucial. We propose a solution based on a sliding window algorithm to address these problems and analyse its effectiveness in terms of fairness and security. Furthermore, we present a quantitative, analytical model in order to assess its capacity to balance the hash power provided by heterogeneous miners. Our study considers the trade-off between the need to trust the entire consortium of miners guaranteed by the global HP invested by the mining process and the need to prevent collusion among malicious miners aimed at reaching 50% of the total HP. As a result, the model can be used to find the optimal parameters for the sliding window protocol. © 2013 IEEE.","fairness; Markov models; Permissioned blockchain; securityBlockchain; Economic and social effects; Fault tolerance; Markov processes; Block-chain; Byzantine fault tolerance; Computational effort; Consensus protocols; Fairness; Markov modeling; Permissioned blockchain; Power; Proof of work; Security; Miners","非CCF推荐");

Current spectrum schemes have limitations when applied to UAV networks due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks that require adaptive spectrum decisions and robust schemes that provide seamless and reliable services. Existing surveys mostly focus on UAV applications, channel models, and security challenges, with a lack of studies on spectrum management in the context of UAV networks. Further, current spectrum efforts focus on terrestrial networks that feature fixed infrastructure and less dynamicity as compared to UAV networks. This motivates the need to revisit existing approaches and identify suitable schemes that allow for the rapid integration of UAVs with existing wireless technologies. Motivated by this observation, this article presents a comprehensive survey on spectrum management for UAV operations. It identifies suitable management schemes that align with UAV features and requirements to enable safe and efficient usage of the radio spectrum. The article assumes coexistence with prevalent wireless technologies that occupy the spectrum. It first presents the ruling from policymakers and regulators and discusses operation bands and radio interfaces. It then introduces deployment scenarios (applications and architectures) as standalone or heterogeneous networks. This is followed by a systematic structure for the management tools that employ deterministic, opportunistic, and competitive schemes. In addition, network monitoring, patrolling, and enforcement schemes are identified.

Firstly, health data is fragmented and its quality needs to be improved. Data fragmentation means that it is difficult to integrate the patient data stored by multiple health service providers. The quality of these heterogeneous data also needs to be improved for better utilization. Secondly, data sharing among patients, healthcare service providers and medical researchers is inadequate. Thirdly, while sharing health data, patients’ right to privacy must be protected, and patients should have authority over who can access their data. In traditional health data sharing system, because of centralized management, data can easily be stolen, manipulated. These systems also ignore patient’s authority and privacy. Researchers have proposed some blockchain-based health data sharing solutions where blockchain is used for consensus management. Blockchain enables multiple parties who do not fully trust each other to exchange their data. However, the practice of smart contracts supporting these solutions has not been studied in detail. We propose CrowdMed-II, a health data management framework based on blockchain, which could address the above-mentioned problems of health data. We study the design of major smart contracts in our framework and propose two smart contract structures. We also introduce a novel search contract for searching patients in the framework. We evaluate their efficiency based on the execution costs on Ethereum. Our design improves on those previously proposed, lowering the computational costs of the framework.

However, hacking, such as ECUs in automobiles, creates problems that are directly connected to human life. Therefore, this study wrote a paper that detects anomalies in such cars by field. As a related study, the study investigated the vulnerabilities of the automobile security committee and automobile security standards and investigated the detection of abnormalities in the hacking of geo‐train cars using artificial intelligence’s LSTM and blockchain consensus algorithm. In addition, in automobile security, an algorithm was studied to predict normal and abnormal values using LSTM‐based anomaly detection techniques on the premise that automobile communication networks are largely divided into internal and external networks. In the methodology, LSTM’s pure propagation malicious code detection technique was used, and it worked with an artificial intelligence consensus algorithm to in-crease security. In addition, Unity ML conducted an experiment by constructing a virtual environ-ment using the Beta version. The LSTM blockchain consensus node network was composed of 50,000 processes to compare performance. For the first time, 100 Grouped Tx, 500 Channels were tested for performance. For the first time, the malicious code detection rate of the existing system was verified. Accelerator, Multichannel, Sharding, Raiden, Plasma, and Trubit values were verified, and values of approximately 15,000 to 50,000 were obtained. In this paper, we studied to become a paper of great significance on hacking that threatens human life with the development of self‐driv-ing cars in the future. © 2021 by the author.

In PoS, the blockchain user provides transaction fees to encourage the mining pool to recruit verifiers for block propagation verification. Both the blockchain user and mining pool can benefit from more verifiers, but get the higher cost. This paper studies the conflict of interest between the blockchain user and mining pool in PoS of the sharing economic blockchain network from the perspective of Nash negotiation, and weighs the transaction fee and the number of verifiers to construct the Nash negotiation game model. Then, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash negotiation solution in the Nash negotiation game model is proved, and the optimal decision of the blockchain user and mining pool is obtained. Finally, numerical examples are used to analyze the impact of the communication cost and the number of verifiers on the optimal decision-making and utility of the blockchain user and mining pool. The research results show that both the blockchain user and mining pool can benefit from lower communication costs. And the Nash negotiation game model can effectively solve the conflict of interests between users and miners in the sharing economic blockchain network and improve network efficiency. © 2022, Editorial Office of Control and Decision.

Consensus algorithm is one of the core elements of blockchain architecture, and a strong, reliable and efficient consensus algorithm is very much required for a blockchain network in order to prevent the intrusion of malicious nodes. A good consensus algorithm drives the blockchain network in the right direction by keeping the malicious transactions off the chain. Thus, in this article, a novel consensus algorithm referred to as efficient practical Byzantine fault tolerance (E-PBFT) is proposed for a private blockchain. E-PBFT finds the winner miner for mining the candidate blocks in an efficient manner which reduces the number of messages exchanged between the nodes. Further, in order to give additional security, a hidden winner miner concept is also included in E-PBFT which hides the winner miner from the adversaries, so that the adversaries will never come to know who is mining the transactions. The theoretical proof for the proposed algorithm is also given whose results are quite convincing when compared to classical PBFT algorithm. The proposed E-PBFT will definitely strengthen the blockchain network by quickly reaching the consensus and by hiding the winner miner, thereby giving additional security. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Consensus algorithm; Decentralisation; PBFT; Permissioned blockchain; Private blockchainFault tolerance; Miners; Network security; Block-chain; Byzantine fault tolerance; Consensus algorithms; Decentralisation; Decentralized networks; Distributed networks; PBFT; Permissioned blockchain; Private blockchain; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

Therefore, the quality of food and food products concerns not only all the end consumers but also millions of employees and entrepreneurs within the global food industry. Achieving the best possible quality of food throughout all the engaged processes requires constantly tracing and monitoring several crucial environmental conditions that may have a significant impact on the products' quality. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a system of dedicated sensors paired with the Internet that can overcome and prevent issues within the food industry. The interconnected elements bear the responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, and tracking the conditions where the food products undergo processing, and it checks the products' quality throughout their life cycle. Nevertheless, even IIoT has its challenges. The first such challenge relates to the storage and accessibility of the obtained data. What can make the data readily available to all individuals and entities involved in the industry? The second significant challenge relates to tracing items that pass through numerous processes involving different parties. This work proposed ProChain, a Provenance-aware Traceability Framework for IoT-based Supply Chain Systems. A proposed comprehensive framework of all the information acquired by the sensors and the complete set of provenance data addressed these challenges. Additionally, a thorough simulation of the proposed framework on the Raspberry PI 3B IoT device reviewed the ProChain efficiency in the cloud and local simulation environments. ProChain demonstrated tractability, transparency, and complex security as examples of the principal attributes of the IOTA 2.0 protocol in the food industry. © 2013 IEEE.","Internet of Things; IoT; Provenance; Supply chain management; TraceabilityBlockchain; Digital storage; Food products; Internet of things; Life cycle; Block-chain; Current values; End consumers; Environmental conditions; Food industries; Food system; Global economies; Provenance; Supply chain systems; Traceability; Supply chain management","非CCF推荐");

Successful cyber attacks on nation-states have proved that cyber threats can jeopardize significant national interests. In response, nation-states have begun to handle cyber threats at the national defense level, which is titled ‘cyber defense.’ The cyber defense sector is related to national security, therefore requires robust security technology. Contrary to normal systems, blockchain provides strong security properties without a centralized control entity, and as such its application in the cyber defense field is under the spotlight. In this paper, we present opportunities blockchain provides for cyber defense, research and national projects, and limitations. We constructed a survey of government documents, interviews, related news, technical reports, and research papers from 2016 to 2021. As a result, our research contributes to reducing the gap in blockchain for cyber defense by systematically conducting research and analysis. In our research, we found that not only research but also government-led plans are actively promoting blockchain, which demonstrates that blockchain will play a remarkable role in cyber defense.

A blockchain-based smart contract management system is an innovative technology foreseen to automate future business-to-business (B2B) processes.

In this paper we present a multi-organizational smart contract management system in which a user can create, deploy, and execute smart contracts.

Owing to this use case, the blockchain system was geared towards efficient storage of data, whereas the processing of complex queries, such as provenance analyses of data history, is out of focus. The increasing use of Internet of Things technologies and the resulting digitization in many domains, however, have led to a plethora of novel use cases for a secure digital ledger. For instance, in the healthcare sector, blockchain systems are used for the secure storage and sharing of electronic health records, while the food industry applies such systems to enable a reliable food-chain traceability, e.g., to prove compliance with cold chains. In these application domains, however, querying the current state is not sufficient—comprehensive history queries are required instead. Due to these altered usage modes involving more complex query types, it is questionable whether today’s blockchain systems are prepared for this type of usage and whether such queries can be processed efficiently by them. In our paper, we therefore investigate novel use cases for blockchain systems and elicit their requirements towards a data store in terms of query capabilities. We reflect the state of the art in terms of query support in blockchain systems and assess whether it is capable of meeting the requirements of such more sophisticated use cases. As a result, we identify future research challenges with regard to query processing in blockchain systems. © 2021 by the authors.

With its numerous added benefits, a blockchain-based learning management system is a commonly utilized methodology at academic institutes, and more specifically during and after the COVID-19 period. It also presents several potentials for decentralized, interoperable record management in the academic system in education.

To improve the trust in the assessment, we propose a novel improved elliptic curve cryptography algorithm (IECCA) for data encryption and decryption. The performance of the suggested method is examined by comparing it with various existing algorithms of encryption. The evaluation of the behaviour of the presented method demonstrates that the technique shall enhance trust in online educational systems, assessment processes, educational history, and credentials. © 2021 by the author.

In a blockchain network, nodes communicate and store data in a distributed manner. Each node executes the same business application but operates in a distinct execution environment. The literature lacks research focusing on continuous practices for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, it lacks such works with support for both design and deployment. The author has proposed a solution that takes into account the continuous delivery of a business application to diverse deployment environments in the DLT network. As a result, two continuous delivery pipelines have been implemented using the Jenkins automation server. The first pipeline prepares a business application whereas the second one generates complete node deployment packages. As a result, the framework ensures the deployment package in the actual version of the business application with the node-specific up-to-date version of deployment configuration files. The Smart Contract Design Pattern has been used when building a business application. The modeling aspect of blockchain network installation has required using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. The refined model-to-code transformation generates deployment configurations for nodes. Both the business application and deployment configurations are stored in the GitHub repositories.

The safety and ongoing maintenance of the smart public transport system from cyberattacks are vitally important. To provide more comprehensive protection against potential cyberattacks, we propose a novel approach that combines blockchain technology and a deep learning method that can better protect the smart public transport system. By the creation of signed and verified blockchain blocks and chaining of hashed blocks, the blockchain in our proposal can withstand unauthorized integrity attack that tries to forge sensitive transport maintenance data and transactions associated with it. A hybrid deep learning-based method, which combines autoencoder (AE) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in our proposal can effectively detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attempts that can halt or block the urgent and critical exchange of transport maintenance data across the stakeholders. The experimental results of the hybrid deep learning evaluated on three different datasets (i.e., CICDDoS2019, CIC-IDS2017, and BoT-IoT) show that our deep learning model is effective to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks achieving more than 95% F1-score across all three datasets in average.

Therefore, to improve brand image and increase market share, many overseas suppliers have adopted or are planning to adopt blockchain, where the production process without ractopamine can be securely monitored and tracked by customers. In this paper, we formulate the overseas supplier's tradeoffs among the cost of blockchain adoption, the expanded market potential, and the intensified competition with the local supplier. Both the overseas product and the local product are procured and resold by a common e-tailer such as JD Worldwide. We compare the profits of all the supply chain parties to identify the “win–win–win” opportunities if the overseas supplier adopts blockchain. Interestingly, we find that the e-tailer tends to determine high procurement prices for both the overseas and the local suppliers if the former's cost of blockchain adoption exceeds a unique threshold. With mild competition and low blockchain adoption cost, both the e-tailer and the overseas supplier are better off with blockchain, but the local supplier's preference is just on the contrary. Therefore, “win–win–win” situation does not exist, while Pareto improvement between the overseas supplier and the e-tailer can be expected if the overseas supplier adopts blockchain. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural products; Blockchain technology; Cross-border e-commerce; Incentive alignmentBlockchain; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Image enhancement; Supply chains; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Cross-border; Cross-border e-commerce; E- commerces; E-tailers; Incentive alignment; Local suppliers; Overseas suppliers; Ractopamine; Agricultural products","非CCF推荐");

The nodes with faulty reputations are excluded from voting. Also, the identified trust node has a high reputation in the consensus process. A majority of voting values select the master node.

Moreover, to ensure long-term unlinkability, the process of anonymization is repeated at regular time intervals (every trading session).

These advanced computing technologies have facilitatedmedical services with minimum cost and available conditions. However, the IoMT raises a high concern on network security and patient data privacy in the health care system. The main issue is the transmission of health data with high security in the fog computing model. In today's market, the best solution is blockchain technology. This technology provides high-end security and authentication in storing and transferring data. In this research, a blockchain-based fog computing model is proposed for the IoMT. The proposed technique embeds a block chain with the yet another consensus (YAC) protocol building security infrastructure into fog computing for storing and transferring IoMT data in the network. YAC is a consensus protocol that authenticates the input data in the block chain. In this scenario, the patients and their family members are allowed to access the data.

To solve this problem, many firms have utilized blockchain technology to provide transparent and traceable information for their products. This study examines optimal strategies for pricing and ‘greenness’ investment for green products with government subsidies and explores the conditions for adopting blockchain technology. First, we find that both retailers and consumers always benefit from a manufacturer's adoption of blockchain technology. When the blockchain's operational cost is small or the consumer valuation uncertainty is high, the social welfare outcome will be positive after the adoption of blockchain technology. Second, although blockchain can reduce the valuation uncertainty for consumers, the demand in the blockchain-supported supply chain is not always higher than that in the traditional supply chain. In addition, when a government subsidizes either the manufacturer or the consumer, adopting blockchain is still profitable for the manufacturer even if the operational cost of blockchain technology is relatively large. However, the result is quite different when the government subsidizes the retailer. In the retailer subsidy program, the manufacturer's adoption of blockchain technology hinges on the level of consumer valuation uncertainty. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain technology; Consumer behavior; Government subsidy; Green product; Supply chain managementBlockchain; Costs; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chain management; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Condition; Consumer valuations; Government subsidies; Green products; Optimal strategies; Social welfare; Uncertainty; Consumer behavior","非CCF推荐");

However, some of them are constructed by attackers to avoid being analyzed, posing a threat to computer network security. The blockchain uses the P2P protocol to implement various functions across the network. Furthermore, the P2P protocol format of blockchain may differ from the standard format specification, which leads to sniffing tools such as Wireshark and Fiddler not being able to recognize them. Therefore, the ability to distinguish different types of unknown network protocols is vital for network security. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on maximum frequent sequences for binary protocols, which can distinguish various unknown protocols to provide support for analyzing unknown protocol formats.We mine the maximum frequent sequences of protocolmessage sets in bytes. Andwe calculate the fuzzymembership of the protocolmessage to each maximum frequent sequence, which is based on fuzzy set theory. Then we construct the fuzzy membership vector for each protocol message. Finally, we adopt K-means++ to split different types of protocol messages into several clusters and evaluate the performance by calculating homogeneity, integrity, and Fowlkes andMallows Index (FMI). Besides, the clustering algorithms based onNeedleman-Wunsch and the fixed-length prefix are compared with the algorithm presented in this paper.

This is particularly true for tourism, which has always been characterized by extensive innovativeness. The pace at which technological innovations diffuse within a specific sector depends on a variety of factors, including the influence of peers and relevant actors. The present study explores the level of interest about these new technologies on social media with the aim to explore the dynamics of reciprocal networking influence in technological diffusion. To capture the attitudes expressed in the industry, the study analyzes the ongoing discussions on Twitter as a proxy for the actors’ interest. Through a social network analysis of the flow of tweets, the analysis maps the current online discourse about new technologies diffusion. Moreover, the sentiment analysis draws the current perceptions toward the diffusion of new technologies. While previous research is focused on the users’ perception toward the development of new technologies in tourism, the aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics underneath the level of diffusion of information and awareness about these new technologies, which still represents an unexplored area of research. Thus, the paper contributes to the literature on new technology diffusion by intercepting current social media debate and literature studies focused on the diffusion of new technologies in tourism.

The miss transparency and efficiency may induce enormous problems in the supply chain and causing human life loss and economic damages. Similarly, Beirut was the case where many lives were lost, and enormous economic losses resulting from the not transparent and efficient treatment of Dangerous Goods (DG). To avoid a situation where DG remains static in a seaport or any warehouse, and while the risk exposition is very high, we propose the concept of a multi-party smart contract.

IoT health data is typically in the form of big data and is frequently coupled with the cloud for secure storage. Cloud technology provides a wide range of technological services via the internet, and it is a highly interoperable and on-demand network for a wide range of computing resources. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is made between the cloud and the patient, and it outlines the services supplied as well as the level of security provided to the user. For fulfilling service, the deployed external cloud has challenges with load balancing and work scheduling. Furthermore, the gathered health data must be effectively processed by medical practitioners. To solve this issue, a Secure Cluster Naive Bayes (CNB) framework is proposed, both with and without Dimensionality Reduction. To preserve its anonymity, the obtained data is hashed and stored in the cloud using the blockchain technology. SLA sessions are organized to prioritize patient data for decryption and prediction. At the doctor’s end, the decrypted data is first filtered and dimensionally reduced before being clustered using a dual K-means clustering technique and classified using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The web-based graphical user interface server is responsible for connecting the IoT device, the cloud, and the doctor. The security performance of the DRCNB and CNB frameworks is evaluated using block chain characteristics, the frequency of SLA violations, and processing and execution time. The DRCNB framework is 91.1% accurate, while the CNB model is 80.73% accurate, making it more accurate than previous models. The new models exceed the prior ones in terms of both security and prediction performance. Â© 2022, Tech Science Press.

The server, acting as a model requester, motivates all devices to train an accurate model by paying them based on their individual contributions. Each participating device needs to balance between the training rewards and costs for profit maximization. A Stackelberg game is proposed to model interactions between the server and devices. To match with reality, our model takes the training deadline and the device-side upload time into consideration. Two reward policies, i.e. the size-based policy and accuracy-based policy, are compared. The existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) under both policies are analyzed. We show that there is a lower bound of 0.5 on the price of anarchy in the proposed game. We extend our model by considering the uncertainty in the upload time. We also utilize the blockchain technique to ensure a truthful, trust-free, and fair system.

System abnormalities or illegal operations can be found in time by analyzing the log and provide evidence for intrusions. In order to ensure the integrity of the log in the current system, many researchers have designed it based on blockchain. However, the emerging blockchain is facing significant security challenges with the increment of quantum computers. An attacker equipped with a quantum computer can extract the user's private key from the public key to generate a forged signature, destroy the structure of the blockchain, and threaten the security of the log system. Thus, blind signature on the lattice in post-quantum blockchain brings new security features for log systems. In our paper, to address these, firstly, we propose a novel log system based on post-quantum blockchain that can resist quantum computing attacks. Secondly, we utilize a post-quantum blind signature on the lattice to ensure both security and blindness of log system, which makes the privacy of log information to a large extent. Lastly, we enhance the security level of lattice-based blind signature under the random oracle model, and the signature size grows slowly compared with others. We also implement our protocol and conduct an extensive analysis to prove the ideas. The results show that our scheme signature size edges up subtly compared with others with the improvement of security level. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

To release the pressure of data management and storage, more and more enterprises and individuals prefer to integrate cloud service with IoT systems, in which the IoT data can be outsourced to cloud server. Since cloud service provider (CSP) is not fully trusted, a variety of methods have been proposed to deal with the problem of data integrity checking. In traditional data integrity audition schemes, the task of data auditing is usually performed by Third Party Auditor (TPA) which is assumed to be trustful. However, in real-life TPA is not trusted as people thought. Therefore, these schemes suffer from the underlying problem of single-point failure. Moreover, most of the traditional schemes are designed by RSA or bilinear map techniques which consume heavy computation and communication cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel data integrity checking scheme for cloud-IoT data based on blockchain technique and homomorphic hash. In our scheme, the tags of all data blocks are computed by a homomorphic hash function and stored in blockchain. Moreover, each step within the process of data integrity checking is signed by the performer, and the signatures are stored in blockchain through smart contracts. As a result, each behavior for data integrity checking in our scheme can be traced and audited which improves the security of the scheme greatly. Furthermore, batch-audition for multiple data challenges is also supported in our scheme. We formalize the system model of our scheme and give the concrete construction. Detailed performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient and practical without the trust-assumption of TPA. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

Trust provides IoT devices with a natural mechanism to judge other devices, similarly to how we tackle security in our human society. Trust relationship among IoT devices provides a means to influence the future behaviours of their communication. Services and resources should be shared with a requesting device only if other devices trust that device. An access control system equipped with a trust management allows the computation of trust to make efficient decision in controlling access to resources. TACL is an advanced access control system that takes trust information into consideration before allowing subjects to perform operations on resources.

This study found that main problem is not blockchain itself, but the surrounding infrastructure which has to be transformed at the same pace and direction. Furthermore, concerning identity management, it was found that the technology provides considerable improvement over database-based systems of identity and user authentication, however, it still contains systemic avenues of centralisation, through which a denial-of-service attack could increase. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attacks; Blockchain; Decentralisation; Identity; Privacy; Transparency","非CCF推荐");

Although IoT provides new opportunities, security remains a key concern while providing various services. Existing research methodologies try to solve the security and time-consuming problem also exists. To solve those problems, this paper proposed a Hashed Advanced Encryption Standard (HAES) algorithm based efficient key management system for internet-based lightweight devices in IoT networks. The proposed method is mainly divided into two phases namely Data Owner (DO) and Data User (DU) phase. The DO phase consists of two processes namely authentication and secure data uploading. In authentication, the registration process consists of three phases namely KGC, SCC and DVC. In Key Generation Center (KGC), the device ID is converted into a 128-bit hash key using the Point on Curve based Fowler–Noll–Vo (PoC-FNV) algorithm. In DVC, the Data Access Policy (DAP) is created by using the selected attributes which is in turn selected by using the Chen Chaotic Chimp Optimization Algo-rithm(CCCOA). Thus, the authentication information is stored in the blockchain. If the person is an authorized, then the data is securely stored and uploaded into the cloud server using HAES. In the DU phase, the DU sends the data access request to the blockchain then the blockchain forwards the request to the DO, if the DO accepts the request then the DU obtains the data by using the DAP. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing methods and attains better result than the existing research methodologies. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

However, the current economic form in China is still expanding, and the payment of CBEC platform needs to be changed to adapt to the high-intensity cross-border payment. With the emergence of blockchain technology (BT), there are new opportunities and challenges in CBEC platform payment. Based on BT, the program cost in cross-border payment can be simplified and multi-party series connection can be carried out. This paper studies the payment system of CBEC platform based on BT, clarifies the characteristics of blockchain, and studies the cross-border e-payment based on blockchain. The transformation of payment process is based on the foundation of de tripartite and de centralization. This paper designs the CBEC payment system based on the blockchain.

Two of the most important challenges to be addressed concern the protection of smart objects and the need to guarantee them a great autonomy. For this purpose, the definition of trust and reputation mechanisms appears crucial. At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework. In this paper, we describe in detail our framework, its behavior, the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomy; Blockchain; Internet of Things; Protection; Reliability; Reputation; TrustBlockchain; Trusted computing; Autonomy; Block-chain; Protection; Reputation; Reputation mechanism; Smart objects; Trust; Trust and reputation; Trust mechanism; Two tiers; Internet of things","C");

However, most of the access mechanisms cannot be applicable to the industrial application as it is based on a centralized architecture. This architecture has a complexity of computation overhead to deteriorate the performance of device-to-device (D2D) communication. In the industrial sectors, security and privacy preservation are majorly concerned to perform expensive operations and to prevent malicious cloud servers. Moreover, the real-time objects should be coordinated to optimize communication efficiencies. Thus, this paper presents a robust blockchain-based lightweight distributed architecture (RB-LDA) for 5G-enabled networks. The proposed RB-LDA authenticates the device access that advertises genuine data possession to restrict the key exposure. Moreover, the qualitative analysis proves the identity management continuously monitors the activities of IoT devices to perform a better auditing process.

However, there have been many efforts to apply blockchain to other fields where trust and transparency are a requirement. The ability to reliably share pharmaceutical information between various stakeholders is essential. The use of blockchain technology adds traceability and visibility to supply chains such as pharmaceuticals to provide all the information from end to end. Currently, the data is stored and managed by large manufacturers and pharmacy retailers using their own centralized systems. Several existing approaches and methods that allow pharmaceutical information to be stored and shared between the healthcare provider and other stakeholders in a centralized manner have been discussed in the literature. Due to the lack of comprehensive literature review studies that focus on pharmaceutical supply chain using blockchain technology, thus this paper highlights and addresses this gap. This paper reviews several studies which have applied blockchain technology in pharmaceutical supply chains. This paper overviews the knowledge on blockchain technology, discusses and explores the most recent and relevant studies that adopt blockchain technology in the field of pharmaceutical supply chains, describes the challenges associated with blockchain technology, and presents some ideas for future work. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Literature review; Pharmaceutical supply chain; Research challenges","非CCF推荐");

However, there are some security threats in the allocation process, such as unreal resources and denial of service, in which the trusted resource allocation becoming a critical research content. Blockchain technology is one important solution for this problem, but the high-delay and low-throughput shortcomings in blockchain cannot fulfill the requirements of time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we firstly utilize a reputation evaluation mechanism to calculate and rate the servers’ reputation values in the resource allocation process. The high-reputation servers are added as candidate leaders into a block generation group, while the remaining low-reputation edge servers are added as verifiers into a block verification group. Secondly, we utilize a round-robin mechanism to choose a leader from the block generation group. The leader is responsible for generating a new block in each timeslot and is updated in different timeslots. Thirdly, we utilize a reward and punishment mechanism to encourage low-reputation servers to participate in consensus. Finally, we propose a proof-of-reputation consensus mechanism to realize the trusted resource allocation based on smart contracts, which can match the end users with high-reputation edge servers automatically. Simulation results show the consensus delay and throughput of resource allocation achieve significant performance improvements in comparison with current schemes, and the system is more sensitive to dishonest edge servers and quickly reduces their reputation values. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Consensus mechanism; Edge computing; Reputation evaluation; Resource allocation; Smart contractsBlockchain; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Resource allocation; Application scenario; Block-chain; Consensus mechanism; Edge computing; Edge server; End-users; Reputation evaluation; Resources allocation; Security threats; Timeslots; Smart contract","C");

The IoT fitness devices collect trainee data that is being used for various decision-making. However, it will face numerous security and privacy issues towards its realization. This work focuses on IoT security, especially DoS/DDoS attacks. In this paper, we have proposed a novel blockchain-enabled protocol (BEP) that uses the notion of a self-exposing node (SEN) approach for securing fitness IoT applications. The blockchain and SDN architectures are employed to enhance IoT security by a highly preventive security monitoring, analysis and response system. The proposed approach helps in detecting the DoS/DDoS attacks on the IoT fitness system and then mitigating the attacks. The BEP is used for handling Blockchain-related activities and SEN could be a sensor or actuator node within the fitness IoT system. SEN provides information about the inbound and outbound traffic to the BEP which is used to analyze the DoS/DDoS attacks on the fitness IoT system. The SEN calculates the inbound and outbound traffic features’ entropies and transmits them to the Blockchain in the form of transaction blocks. The BEP picks the whole mined blocks’ transactions and transfers them to the SDN controller node. The controller node correlates the entropies data of SENs and decides about the DoS or DDoS attack. So, there are two decision points, one is SEN, and another is the controller. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, several experiments are performed and results concerning the entropy values and attack detection rate are obtained. The proposed approach has outperformed the other two approaches concerning the attack detection rate by an increase of 11% and 18% against Approach 1 and Approach 2 respectively. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Routing attacks have the potential to destroy and degrade the functionality of WSNs. A trustworthy routing system is essential for routing security and WSN efficiency. Numerous methods have been implemented to build trust between routing nodes, including the use of cryptographic methods and centralized routing. Nonetheless, the majority of routing techniques are unworkable in reality due to the difficulty of properly identifying untrusted routing node activities. At the moment, there is no effective way to avoid malicious node attacks. As a consequence of these concerns, this paper proposes a trusted routing technique that combines blockchain infrastructure, deep neural networks, and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to improve the security and efficiency of WSN routing. To authenticate the transmission process, the suggested methodology makes use of a Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism inside the blockchain network. The validation group required for proofing is chosen using a deep learning approach that prioritizes each node’s characteristics. MDPs are then utilized to determine the suitable next-hop as a forwarding node capable of securely transmitting messages.

However, in today’s explosive growth of network data, traditional distributed storage scheme is faced with some severe challenges such as insufficient performance, data tampering, and data lose. A distributed storage scheme based on blockchain has been proposed to improve security and efficiency of traditional distributed storage. Under this scheme, the following improvements have been made in this paper. This paper first analyzes the problems faced by distributed storage. Then proposed to build a new distributed storage blockchain scheme with sharding blockchain. The proposed scheme realizes the partitioning of the network and nodes by means of blockchain sharding technology, which can improve the efficiency of data verification between nodes. In addition, this paper uses polynomial commitment to construct a new verifiable secret share scheme called PolyVSS. This new scheme is one of the foundations for building our improved distributed storage blockchain scheme. Compared with the previous scheme, our new scheme does not require a trusted third party and has some new features such as homomorphic and batch opening. The security of VSS can be further improved.

Also, COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need of remote monitoring of patients to reduce chances of infection among physicians and healthcare workers. To this end, Fog computing has emerged, where cloud computing is extended to the edge of the network to reduce latency and network congestion. This large amount of data is downloaded and stored on remote public cloud servers to which users cannot be fully trusted, especially when we are dealing with sensitive data like health data. In this scenario, meeting the confidentiality and patient privacy requirements becomes urgent for a large deployment of cloud systems. In this context, we offer a solution to secure the personal data of the e-Health system and protect the privacy of patients in an IoT–Fog–cloud environment while being based on cryptographic techniques especially CP-ABE and the blockchain paradigm.

This P2P network is generated and maintained by the participating peers in a distributed manner through peer discovery, neighbor selection and managing inbound/outbound connections. As these tasks require extra consumption of network bandwidth, energy, memory and CPU usage, resource-limited devices may not support inherent blockchain applications. Further, changes in the topology control functions or reconfiguration should be considered by all peers to fully benefit from the new performance, which can take time. The aim of this paper is to build a blockchain network in a manner that greatly reduce topology control overhead while guaranteeing the properties such as high flexibility, fast reconfigurability, connectivity, small diameter and clustering. For this, we propose to use the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to manage the blockchain P2P network. This way, the topology control tasks are moved off the peers to a secure overlay layer composed of multiple servers having synchronized databases. This new layer is responsible for building and managing the topological structure of the P2P network layer based on random r-out digraphs. Next, we mathematically discuss r-out digraphs generation using binomial distribution and preferential attachment models. Then, and in order to reduce the number of connections per peer, we establish lower and minimum upper bounds on outbound and inbound connections respectively that still guarantee the P2P network feasibility and connectivity. Further, we investigate topological properties of blockchain P2P network such as connectivity, diameter and clustering. Finally, we provide extensive simulation and numerical results to verify the efficiency of our approach and illustrate the effects of centralized topology control on network performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Binomial distribution model; Blockchain; Connectivity; Network properties; Peer to peer network; Preferential attachment model; r-out digraph; SDN paradigm; Topology control; Uniform distribution modelBlockchain; Directed graphs; Network layers; Binomial distribution; Binomial distribution model; Block-chain; Connectivity; Distribution models; Network properties; Peer-to-peer networks; Preferential attachment model; R-out digraph; Software-defined networking paradigm; Software-defined networkings; Topology control; Uniform distribution; Uniform distribution model; Peer to peer networks","C");

Its underlying protocol defines how transactions and blocks are distributed through all participating nodes. To protect user privacy, the identity of the node originating a message is kept hidden. However, an adversary observing the whole network can analyze the spread pattern of a transaction to trace it back to its source. This is possible thanks to the so-called rumor centrality, which is caused by the symmetry in the spreading of gossip-like protocols. Recent works try to address this issue by breaking the symmetry of the Diffusion protocol, currently used in Bitcoin, and leveraging proxied broadcast. Nonetheless, the complexity of their design can be a barrier to their adoption in real life. In this work, we propose Clover, a novel transaction relay protocol that protects the source of transaction messages with a simple, yet effective, design. Compared to previous solutions, our protocol does not require building propagation graphs, and reduces the ability of the adversary to gain precision by opening multiple connections towards the same node. Experimental results show that the deanonymization accuracy of an eavesdropper adversary against Clover is up to 10 times smaller compared to Diffusion. © 2021, The Author(s).","Anonymity; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Data propagationBitcoin; Peer to peer networks; Anonymity; Anonymous transaction; Block-chain; Breakings; Data propagation; Diffusion protocols; P2P network; Reference benchmarks; Simple++; User privacy; Blockchain","C");

We develop a decentralized music file-sharing platform, where music file owners can upload the music files, and music file requesters can download the music files. We also establish a fair rewarding mechanism for the music industry for the benefit of music file owners, where music files can be traded through smart contracts between the music file owners and file requesters. Further, we implement a penalty scheme to avoid malicious and illegal music file resources to be added to the community network. This approach is ideal for addressing the problem of illegal distribution of copyright-protected music files without the consent of the owners, which has negative consequences in the music industry. This model considers a community of people networked together, where music file owners can upload their music files to a community network server on approval of the majority of the community and the file requesters can request a paid download from the community network. Music file uploading and downloading transactions are voted and signed by the online community members. All parties are rewarded with an incentive fee per valid transaction. Transactions are handled through self-executing smart contracts. This model further analyzes the costs incurred in music file uploading and downloading transactions based on the uploading/downloading cost, the transaction fee and the networking cost. Perceiving the significance of the smart contract in the music industry, we determine that the effect of illegal downloading of copyright-protected music files can be reduced. We also emphasize the challenges associated with the adoption of the smart contract. Since blockchain interoperability is yet an issue, migrating applications in a heterogeneous network or between platforms can be costly and tedious, which should be further explored in the future.

In view of this, we present three simple and practical VRF constructions from the RSA hardness assumption, the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption and the Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) respectively, the output size of which is continuously reduced for the design of efficient consensus protocol in blockchain.

We illustrate a general approach to integrate our VRF constructions with block structure in blockchain.

Known solutions provide certain level of security but lack some qualities required for wide usage. Among the obstacles are scaling distributed solutions and constructing exchange between separate robust distributed ledgers. The paper presents multidimensional blockchain— an approach to building robust distributed ledgers based on the notion of blockchain. The solution can be implemented in two approaches: block mode and state machine mode. A general security analysis, mathematical security analysis, and GUC-framework analysis are performed. Mathematical analysis is based on existing works on security of one-dimensional blockchain and consensus algorithms. A GUC-model is created to prove security of multidimensional blockchain. It is proven that multidimensional blockchain securely implements robust distributed ledger and provides secure inter-system exchange given that search and verification protocol is secure.

Usually, the trust models are employed in MANETs for guaranteeing the transactions’ success, where the peers’ mobility is handled by either periodically broadcasting Hello messages or constructing multi-layered network structure. However, such trust models would largely increase the communication complexity. The consensus mechanism used in Blockchain gives us a hint to establish a consensus-based trust model in MANETs. To reduce the communication complexity, we use the super peer-based network structure as the application scenario of our trust model, LocTrust, based on which we propose a local consensus algorithm and a global consensus algorithm for different transacting cases. Also, we use the discrete trust expressions to further improve the LocTrust model’s availability. To evaluate the performance, we took a file sharing system as the application scenario of the trust model, where the parameters of the simulation area size, the wireless transmission range, the number of files and the number of peers are employed. Besides, four types of peers are used to simulate the real-world environments, including normal peer (NP), completely malicious peer (CMP), randomly malicious peer (RMP) and feedback malicious peer (FMP). Also, in the simulations, NP:CMP:RMP:FMP is set to 65:15:10:10. The simulation results showed that the LocTrust model could both improve the resource search success rate and reduce the communication complexity under the super peer-based MANET structure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Consensus; Local and global; Mobile ad hoc network (MANET); Super peer-based MANET structure; Trust modelComplex networks; Computational complexity; Network layers; Security of data; Consensus; Local and global; Malicious peer; Mobile ad hoc network; Mobile ad-hoc networks; Network structures; Super peer-based mobile ad hoc network structure; Super-peer; Trust models; Mobile ad hoc networks","C");

The link between international trade and technological change is complementary and mutually reinforcing. Innovative technology is an imperative trend, which can improve the competitiveness of products and make the country dominate in international trade. Therefore, promoting technological progress and enhancing its role in trade has become a top priority. International technology trade is an important way to open up the international market, improve trade structure, and enhance international competitiveness.

The use of IoT technology in modern healthcare environments is convenient for doctors and patients as it can be used in real-time monitoring of patients, proper administration of patient information, and healthcare management. However, the usage of IoT in the healthcare domain will become a nightmare if patient information is not securely maintained while transferring over an insecure network or storing at the administrator end. In this manuscript, the authors have developed a secure IoT healthcare monitoring system using the Blockchain-based XOR Elliptic Curve Cryptography (BC-XORECC) technique to avoid various vulnerable attacks. Initially, the work has established an authentication process for patient details by generating tokens, keys, and tags using Length Ceaser Cipher-based Pearson Hashing Algorithm (LCC-PHA), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Fishers Yates Shuffled Based Adelson-Velskii and Landis (FYS-AVL) tree. The authentications prevent unauthorized users from accessing or misuse the data. After that, a secure data transfer is performed using BC-XORECC, which acts faster by maintaining high data privacy and blocking the path for the attackers. Finally, the Linear Spline Kernel-Based Recurrent Neural Network (LSK-RNN) classification monitors the patient's health status. The whole developed framework brings out a secure data transfer without data loss or data breaches and remains efficient for health care monitoring via IoT. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed framework achieves a faster encryption and decryption time, classifies the patient's health status with an accuracy of 89%, and remains robust compared with the existing state-of-the-art method. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Due to extensive data exchange over the Internet, the smart grid faces many security challenges that have led to data loss, data compromise, and high power consumption. Moreover, the lack of hardware protection and physical attacks reduce the overall performance of the smart grid network. We proposed the BLIDSE model (Blockchain-based secure quantum key distribution and Intrusion Detection System in Edge Enables Smart Grid Network) to address these issues. The proposed model includes five phases: The first phase is blockchain-based secure user authentication, where all smart meters are first registered in the blockchain, and then the blockchain generates a secret key. The blockchain verifies the user ID and the secret key during authentication matches the one authorized to access the network. The secret key is shared during transmission through secure quantum key distribution (SQKD). The second phase is the lightweight data encryption, for which we use a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm, named Camellia. The third phase is the multi-constraint-based edge selection; the data are transmitted to the control center through the edge server, which is also authenticated by blockchain to enhance the security during the data transmission. We proposed a perfect matching algorithm for selecting the optimal edge. The fourth phase is a dual intrusion detection system which acts as a firewall used to drop irrelevant packets, and data packets are classified into normal, physical errors and attacks, which is done by Double Deep Q Network (DDQN). The last phase is optimal user privacy management. In this phase, smart meter updates and revocations are done, for which we proposed Forensic based Investigation Optimization (FBI), which improves the security of the smart grid network. The simulation is performed using network simulator NS3.26, which evaluates the performance in terms of computational complexity, accuracy, false detection, and false alarm rate. The proposed BLIDSE model effectively mitigates cyber-attacks, thereby contributing to improved security in the network. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Blockchain has many security and performance issues that need attention. It facilitates the interaction between two parties who can interact without a third party to accept this transaction. This leads to the creation of smart contracts that help the blockchain to execute more efficiently. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain. Any modification after execution is not allowed. This causes a problem that is not solved by many scientists. This paper proposes a solution to this problem by creating a modifying blockchain that will hold all the modified data to be added to the smart contract using Ethereum. The proposed solution allows the modification to happen in a separate blockchain associated with the main blockchain containing the smart contract. This will result in faster execution, easier modifying and less used storage. Ethereum used to deploy the blockchain while deploying the smart contract requires a programing language that supports all the necessary requirements for deployment.

The challenge of food loss and waste is prominent in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Goals, which demands halving the per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030. Consumer awareness of food safety and health has also greatly increased in the last few decades; correspondingly, confidence in the quality of food has greatly decreased. Studies show that local and organic foods are perceived by consumers to be relatively healthier, and this new interest has led to academics and industry practitioners exploring a holistic understanding of FSCs a to tackle such emerging challenges. Several studies have examined FSCs through the lenses of circular economy principles, leading to the emerging term, circular food supply chains (CFSCs). Emergent digital technologies, including blockchain technologies (BCT), are touted to provide traceability, transparency and scalability which, if applied in FSCs, may help to address many of these challenges. However, the theory and technology of circular economy and BCT have, to-date, had only limited influence on FSCs due to inherent and/or perceived application risks. Further, there is a need for more considered and strategic integration of digital technologies, in general, as mechanisms for identify and mitigating potential risks, and achieving desired outcomes. Using a hybrid modelling approach of fuzzy set theory and interpretive structural modelling, this paper develops and proposes a framework in identifying and analysing these integration risks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain technologies; Circular economy; Food supply chainFood supply; Fuzzy set theory; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Circular economy; Digital technologies; Food loss; Food supply chain; Food waste; Hybrid model; Per capita; United Nations; Blockchain","非CCF推荐");

The software is organized as a multi-level simulator that permits to simulate a virtual environment, made of many nodes running the protocol of a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as the Bitcoin or the Ethereum blockchains. This virtual environment is executed on top of a lower-level Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlay, which can be structured based on different topologies and with a given number of nodes and edges. Functionalities at different levels of abstraction are managed separately, by different software modules and with different time granularity. This allows for accurate simulations, where (and when) it is needed, and enhances the simulation performance. Using LUNES-Blockchain, it is possible to simulate different types of attacks on the DLT. In this paper, we specifically focus on the P2P layer, considering the selfish mining, the 51% attack and the Sybil attack. For which concerns selfish mining and the 51% attack, our aim is to understand how much the hash-rate (i.e. a general measure of the processing power in the blockchain network) of the attacker can influence the outcome of the misbehavior. On the other hand, in the filtering denial of service (i.e. Sybil Attack), we investigate which dissemination protocol in the underlying P2P network makes the system more resilient to a varying number of nodes that drop the messages.

It consists of various Internet-connected sensors, software applications, to connect different devices. This makes the smart grid network more complex which is further vulnerable to the cyber-attack. Moreover, it gives rise to various malicious attack such as false data injection (FDI) in smart meters which leads to incorrect decisions due to a large number of open access points in a network; which is accessible to outside intruders. In smart meters, Home Area Network (HAN) and smart meter collectors are more vulnerable for cyber-attacks as they are directly involved in bi-directional communication between the devices such as smart grid, data connectors, and smart meters. Since smart meters work in a distributed environment where fog computing (FC) placed at the edge of the networks can play a major role by integrating with blockchain for secure electric data transmission and to avoid the FDI in smart meters.

In this paper we propose an adaption of hash based PoW’s. This adaption consists in two aspects, firstly by embedding the space of the hash’s, H, in the space of complex numbers C, more concretely in the subset B= { z∈ C: 0 &lt; Re(z) &lt; 1 }, Φ : H↪ B and secondly in designing a new cryptographic puzzle in the hash space. The motivation behind these adaptions is that in this way the PoW can also be used to explore the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF). The RZF is associated with an open problem about the localization of its zeros. This problem was left as a conjecture by Riemann and is considered one of the most important open mathematical questions. The permanence of the problem is due to the mysterious behavior of the RZF in the region B. This region will be by translation the search region used in the new cryptographic puzzle. The PoW will thus be able to contribute to a better understanding of the behaviour of the RZF in the region B. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","非CCF推荐");

Within this trend, electricity grid generation and intermediary elements (e.g. batteries) are distributed, promoting a new business model where the consumers have become prosumers. That is to say, they can both generate and consume energy. The distributed energy generation is based on renewable (mainly, photovoltaics) and storage (i.e. batteries). However, the produced energy is unpredictable without forecasting tools and intermittent (i.e. dependent on the solar resources). Additionally, although the priority is the usage of this energy for self-consumption, the surplus of energy is usually sold to the DSO (Distribution System Operator). Then, the usage of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading fosters new business models and novel paradigms of energy system generation where people can generate their own energy and share it locally with each other. The aforementioned factors have encouraged a wider adoption of microgrids powered by renewable distributed energy sources and they provide a lot of economic and environmental benefits. For that end, this paper presents a P2P approach, combined with demand and production forecasting, to enable novel prosumers’ business models and promoting renewable energy communities for energy transition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Energy trading; Energy transition; Microgrid; P2P; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

These strategies aim not only regional planning, but also economic development and people’s quality of life. This refers to the concept of smart territories. To achieve their objectives, smart territories generally use citizens’ data to offer them services and support them in better individualized decision-making. However, a major problem arises in data management, as it is necessary to have the consent of users to access and use data. In this article, we propose a generic blockchain-based model for consent-based data sharing in the context of smart territories, while putting users at the center of control of their data. We take advantage of ADA-M (Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix), a matrix that provides a standardized way to unambiguously represent conditions related to discovery and access to data. We couple the use of ADA-M with a blockchain anchor system, which helps secure consent management for data access. This helps to develop an environment of digital trust for sharing data between users. Then, through a digital token, we offer a system of rewards for users in cases where their data is used for commercial purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","非CCF推荐");

The proposed protocol is a blockchain-based unidirectional off-chain payment mechanism using a novel Merkel tree-based smart contract. MARI allows producers to communicate the fee structure directly to their consumers. It grants total control over producers’ inbound payment flow, which an intermediary mediates and preserves the low overhead on the producers and consumers at the same time.

European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rebalances rights and obligations of data controllers processing personal data and data subjects whose data are being processed. Well-tailored and targeted use of blockchain technologies enables system transactions that strengthen individual regain of control over personal data and securely transfer it. The proposed system (PPAMIPP, public platform for authorised minimal invasive privacy protection) allows data subjects to claim the personal data processed by them and request their transfer in accordance with the GDPR by defining a respective novel process and supporting technical architecture. The proposed system is validated using a prototype implementation. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of the system while maintaining confidentiality and integrity, the trade-offs between privacy and usability, as well as general problems of the defined process from legal and technical viewpoints, are highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","非CCF推荐");

This technology seems to be very promising and has proven a big efficiency in ensuring trust among the network. It innovates and proposes new forms of governance and capital allocation, it promises decentralized financial services of credit, exchange, insurance, etc. It is the interweaving of computer programs, called smart contracts in a decentralized network, which replace traditional intermediaries and automate business processes. To make smart contracts in the blockchain context consistent and worthy, they must rely on solid data from the outside world, such as market prices observed on all exchange places for example. Blockchains are autonomous systems that are not natively designed to integrate data from the “outside”, thus, oracles are external systems that solve the problem of feeding an isolated network with data from the outside. On the other hand, these systems are centralized, consequently, they grant a high risk of data corruption and unreliability issues. In this paper, we present our decentralized oracle approach, based on a Dag (directed acyclic graph) model, its implementation as well as an evaluation of its accuracy in the context of live dynamic financial market data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; DAG; Decentralized oracle; Peer-to-peer; Tangle","非CCF推荐");

Social distancing and self-isolation have become very important to reduce the spread. This called upon the creation of numerous applications that have used proprietary models for symptoms-tracking and contact-tracing around the world to mitigate the spread. In most of the applications data collected is stored in a centralized database without verification and hence, the data is not reliable. In this study, a decentralized application for COVID-19 symptoms tracking using Blockchain is proposed in order to enhance reliable data collection for training Machine Learning (ML) models. The Blockchain integration in this application will help in collecting COVID-19 symptoms data from the patients with trust. In addition to this, the data would be first verified by an entity of the decentralized network (e.g. a COVID-19 testing lab). Then, with the consent of the patient, this data is provided to the centralized system for retraining the ML. In short, the main advantage of this architecture is that the data from the users is collected and checked by a laboratory first and then provided to the ML model. The process helps in identifying the incorrect ML prediction and further train the ML model with reliable data for accurate prediction. Moreover, the trust of the users is earned as the data transfer happens with their consent and, besides, all transactions are recorded on the Blockchain, which is possible with the help of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","非CCF推荐");

Once a smart contract is deployed on a blockchain due to code immutability, its residual vulnerabilities cannot be patched. Reducing the number of residual vulnerabilities becomes thus very important and normally is achieved through static analyzers. This paper investigates the physical position (location) of vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. To this purpose, we use a language-independent systematization of vulnerabilities and we consider the outputs of a set of static analyzers processing a representative set of smart contracts. We analyze the distributions of the locations where tools find positive outcomes. We create the ground truth of vulnerabilities for a subset S of smart contracts through manual inspection and we first perform a comparison of the distributions within this set. Then we generalize our findings by comparing the distributions between the manually inspected subset and the full set. Such comparison allows us to identify where certain classes of vulnerabilities are located, suggesting specific areas in Solidity smart contracts where the search for vulnerabilities should focus. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Locations; Smart contracts; Solidity; Vulnerabilities","非CCF推荐");

Besides, the learning of syntax, the obstacles often seem insurmountable for the beginner. Syntax errors frustrate and distract attention from the actual algorithms and logic that need to be understood. With the help of visual programming, syntax errors can be avoided as much as possible by using predefined graphical boxes, which, due to their shape, can only be connected correctly to form a program. Moreover, Smart Contracts are mainly designed to exclude the need to trust a third party. Here using Visual programming makes perfect sense by making the creation of Smart Contracts much simpler without the help of a developer. Another advantage of Visual Programming Language (VPL) in Smart Contract creation is that the terms and conditions in Contracts can be read and understood from non-developers.

Patients’ privacy and security concerns was the primary negative factor impacting LPHR adoption. Patients desire to control the privacy of their own LPHR in multiple information systems at various facilities. However, little is known how to model and construct a scalable and interoperable LPHR with patient-controlled privacy and confidentiality that preserves patients’ health information integrity and availability. Understanding this problem and proposing a practical solution are considered important to increase LPHR adoption rate and improve the efficiency as well as the quality of care. Even though having the state-of-the-art encryption methodologies being applied to patients’ data, without a set of secure access control policies being implemented, LPHR patient data privacy is not guaranteed due to insider threats. We proposed a definition of “secure LPHR” and argued LPHR is secure when the security and privacy requirements are fulfilled through adopting an access control security model. In searching for an access control model, we enhanced the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) next generation access control (NGAC) model by replacing the centralized access control policy database with a permissioned blockchain peer-to-peer database, which not only eases the race condition in NGAC, but also provides patient-managed access control policy update capability.

Most networks compromised by intruders are those where the exchange of data is at high risk. The main objective of this paper is to present a solution for secure exchange of attack signatures between the nodes of a distributed network. Malicious activities are monitored and detected by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that operates with nodes connected to a distributed network. The IDS operates in two phases, where the first phase consists of detection of anomaly attacks using an ensemble of classifiers such as Random forest, Convolutional neural network, and XGBoost along with genetic algorithm to improve the performance of IDS. The novel attacks detected in this phase are converted into signatures and exchanged further through the network using the blockchain framework in the second phase. This phase uses the cryptosystem as part of the blockchain to store data and secure it at a higher level. The blockchain is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 and v2.0, to create a prototype for secure signature transfer.

However, it suffers from high transaction costs and mutual distrust among users. To address these issues, we propose a credit-based P2P electricity trading model in a blockchain environment. First, the P2P electricity trading process is introduced, which involves six stages: order generation, default query, order picking, trading execution, trading verification, and payment. Credit management is also introduced in this model to manage the default behavior of users. In particular, the default users are provided a waiting time in the default query stage or penalized in the payment stage. Finally, the model is simulated on the Hyperledger Fabric platform using Docker and Go. Experimental results show that the proposed model can facilitate cost reduction for users in the blockchain and realize credit management in P2P electricity trading, thereby enhancing trading stability and efficiency. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","credit management; electricity trading; Energy blockchain; hyperledger fabric; peer-to-peer (P2P)Blockchain; Cost reduction; Power markets; Credit management; Default behavior; Electricity trading; Order generations; Order picking; Renewable energies; Transaction cost; Waiting-time; Fintech","非CCF推荐");

These postings are generally evaluated and spread among SNS users, but basically, there is no direct profit for the posters. However, when the posting of videos and images in a disaster area spreads, the videos and the images are requested and bought by broadcasters such as public media companies. This means that there is often sufficient monetary value in such a video and an image. It is desirable that the negotiation on contents license between a poster and a broadcaster proceeds promptly and easily. The application of the block chain technology outside of the finance region attracts the attention recently. In particular, Ethereum, which is a platform that enables application construction using smart contracts, is currently being studied for many applications.

The global epidemic enforces consumers to be warned of the originality of food supply. Various technology unification is included to address this problem. Heterogeneous IoT sensors for sensing agricultural or plantation land provide system automation and monitoring for certain commodities. Sensor data and captured images of surveillance cameras are the results of IoT devices sensing capability. However, the originality of the data being stored is questioned; even worse, the data records are deleted. Such as problems occur due to several things: network congestion, device reliability, storage media, and operator. One of the findings proposed in this research is storing sensing results from each sensor and camera surveillance to a global database that is decentralized, immutable, and synchronized, known as the blockchain. All the parties involved in the smart farming system, such as farmers, food suppliers, and customers, are connected to a global blockchain network. Multi-Image Encryption (MIE) yields to secure the authenticity of captured images from multiple cameras. A specific MIE algorithm will compile and randomized the captured image from cameras to produce an encrypted image stored in the blockchain database with a unique identifier. This study provides a simulated model of blockchain technology that can be implemented in a smart farming environment using Ganache as the test net. In the smart contract, every entity connected to the blockchain network appears as a node account that is digitally assigned based on each role. Therefore, the transaction was successfully done from one node to the others. This research is the initial stages of implementing a smart farming system into the unification of various technology in the development of sustainable agriculture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","非CCF推荐");

Meantime, the specifically designed young and fast-evolving programming languages, such as Solidity, become the key factors behind smart contracts being the breeding ground of ubiquitous defects. As many contract defects occur within certain compiler versions, knowing the specific compiler version used to generate the contract's bytecode, facilitates the design of more targeted defect detection approaches, and provides ways to estimate the risks faced of invoking it. To this end, we propose VSmart (compiler Version identification for Smart contract), which takes in the bytecode of the smart contract to be analyzed and outputs the major compiler version used to produce it. The basic idea is to leverage deep neural networks to grasp version-indicative features from contracts' normalized opcode sequences, and train classifiers on a data set consisting of 131,546 smart contracts with ground-truth labels we collected from Etherscan. The performance evaluation conducted shows that VSmart achieves nearly 98% accuracy in identifying major Solidity compiler versions. Further, on the basis of VSmart, we perform an empirical study on the distribution of the Solidity compiler versions on a wild data set consisting of 15,326,672 nontrivial smart contracts actually deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The landscape estimation results show that the Solidity version distribution is rather imbalanced, with Solidity 0.4 being the most popular one; and the developers' Solidity usage practices conflict with the official's suggestion of always using the latest version, while they tend to gradually switch to newer versions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","blockchain; compiler version identification; empirical study; neural network; smart contractBlockchain; Deep neural networks; Defects; Ethereum; Program compilers; Risk perception; Breeding grounds; Defect detection; Empirical studies; Estimation results; Op-code sequence; Second generation; Turing-complete; Version identification; Classification (of information)","C");

We believe that the ability to scale up a blockchain lies mainly in improving the underlying technology rather than deploying new hardware. Though recent research works have applied sharding techniques in enhancing scalability of blockchains, they do not cater for addressing the issue of both data security and scalability in blockchains. In this paper, we propose an approach that makes a trade-off between security and scalability when designing blockchain based systems. We propose an efficient replication model, which creates dynamic sharding wherein blocks are stored in a varying number of nodes. The proposed approach shows that the replication of blockchain over peer-to-peer network is minimized as the blockchain’s length evolves according to a replication factor to preserve the security. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Scalability; Security; Sharding","非CCF推荐");

One way of addressing this problem is through the use of gas price oracles that utilize historical block data to recommend gas prices. However, when transaction volumes increase rapidly, these oracles often underestimate or overestimate the price. In this paper, we demonstrate how Gaussian process models can predict the distribution of the minimum price in an upcoming block when transaction volumes are increasing. This is effective because these processes account for time correlations between blocks. We performed an empirical analysis using the Gaussian process model on historical block data and compared the performance with GasStation-Express and Geth gas price oracles. The results suggest that when transactions volumes fluctuate greatly, the Gaussian process model offers a better estimation. Further, we demonstrated that GasStation-Express and Geth can be improved upon by using a smaller training sample size which is properly pre-processed. Base of empirical analysis, we recommended a gas price oracle made up of a hybrid model consisting of both the Gaussian process and GasStation-Express.

Data needs to be stored by and exchanged between these parties in the process of managing the journey. The fragmented nature of this shared management of mutual clients is a limiting factor in the development of a seamless, hassle-free, end-to-end, travel experience. Traditional interlining agreements attempt to facilitate many separate aspects of co-operation between service providers, typically between airlines and to some extent, intermodal travel operators, including schedules, fares, ticketing, through check-in and baggage handling. These arrangements rely on pre-agreement. The development of Virtual Interlining - that is, interlining facilitated by a third party (often but not always an airport) without formal pre-agreement by the airlines or rail carriers - demonstrates an underlying demand for a better quality end-to-end travel experience. Blockchain solutions are being explored in a number of industries and offer, at first sight, an immutable, single source of truth for this data, avoiding data conflicts and misinterpretation. Combined with Smart Contracts, they seemingly offer a more robust and dynamic platform for multi-stakeholder ventures, and even perhaps the ability to join and leave consortia dynamically. Applying blockchain to the intermodal interlining space – termed Blocklining in this paper - is complex and multi-faceted because of the many aspects of cooperation outlined above.

However, smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks. Tools and programming practices are available to support the development of secure smart contracts. These approaches are effective to mitigate the smart contract vulnerabilities, but the unsophisticated ecosystem of the smart contract prevents these approaches from being foolproof. Besides, the Blockchain immutability does not allow smart contracts deployed in the Blockchain to be updated. Thus, businesses and developers would develop new contracts if vulnerabilities were detected in their smart contracts deployed in Ethereum, which would imply new costs for the business. To support developers and businesses in the smart contract security decision makings, we investigate the applicability of the security code metric from non-blockchain into the smart contract domain. We use the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach to analyze the applicability of these metrics into the smart contract domain based on metric construct and measurement. As a result, we found 15 security code metrics that can be applied to smart contract development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Ethereum; Metric; QGM; Security; Smart contract","非CCF推荐");

Additionally, organisations need to gather the necessary conditions to ensure their quick adaptation to a changing environment and replace reactiveness for proactivity. Collaboration can act as the foundation to an answer for the increase demand for customised products, with an open and transparent environment where information is shared, and actors can work together to solve a common problem. In this work we propose a model definition for an industrial collaboration network composed by a network of entities, with reasoning and interaction, that uses a blockchain for knowledge representation. Current definitions of MAS already include a representation of equipment, transportation, products, and organisations; our contribution proposes the inclusion of the consumer, represented by an agent, directly in the manufacturing process. This agent represents the preferences and needs of the consumer in product customisation scenarios which, together with the other agents, negotiate criteria and cooperate with each other. The network is composed by distinct types of agents, across multiple organisations, that share common objectives. We use Hyperledger Fabric to represent knowledge, assuring that the data is stored and shared with all entities, while keeping the information secure and assuring that it cannot be tampered with. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Collaboration; Industry 4.0; Multi-agent system; Negotiation","非CCF推荐");

For shielding the data from attacks, the IoT data are effectively encrypted with the aid of the XOR-RSA algorithm. Furthermore, Load Balancing (LB) is done utilizing BM-SSA to ameliorate system efficiency. Lastly, the data is securely stored in a BC-centric cloud, where BC stands as a distributed database providing more security.

The public and private blockchains are used for authentication. The authentication of Sensor Nodes (SNs) is performed at the private blockchain, whereas the public blockchain authenticates the cluster heads. The existing malicious node detection methods do not guarantee the authentication of the entities in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The unregistered nodes can easily access the resources of the network and perform malicious activities. Moreover, the malicious nodes broadcast wrong route information that increases packet delay and lowers packet delivery ratio. In the proposed model, the trust value is calculated in order to remove the malicious nodes. The secure routing is performed on the basis of the most trustworthy nodes in the network. The aim is to reduce the packet delay and increase the packet delivery ratio. The simulation results show that the high throughput and packet delivery ratio is achieved due to the presence of highly trusted nodes.

Therefore, in our model, to prevent the participation of malicious nodes in the network, the registration of the nodes is done by a Certificate Authority Node (CAN). Each node that participates in the routing is authenticated by the Base Station (BS) and a mutual authentication is performed. Moreover, the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used in the verification of the registration process.
